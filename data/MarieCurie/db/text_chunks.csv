"the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[4] She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and condu cted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of ""radioactivity""—a term she coined.[5][6] In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conduc ted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. In 1920 she founde d the Curie Institute in Paris, and in 1932 the Curie Institute in Warsaw; both remain major centres of medical research. During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hos pitals.

After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed his children in its use.[14] He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take lower- paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house.[14] Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born.[14] She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old.[14] Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted"

Sikorska; next, she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal.[13] After a collapse, possibly due to depression,[14] she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.[13] Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.[13][14] Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.[13][21] In conne ction with this, Maria took a position as gove rness: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for"

He soon e arned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University.Krakowskie Przedmiescie 66, Warsaw, where Maria did her first scientific work, 1890–91.Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodow ska that had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute, which she had founde d in 1932.[16][22] At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława—who a few months earlier had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris.

Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longe r to gather the necessary funds.[13] She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again.[21] All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself.[21] In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw.[13] She continued working as a gove rness and remained there till late 1891.[21] She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town.[13][14][21] The laboratory was run by he r cousin Józef Bogus ki, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.[13][21][23] In late 1891, she left Poland for France.[24] In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be know n in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891.[25][26] She subsisted on her meagre resources, keeping herself warm during cold winters"

She focused so hard on her studies that she sometimes forgot to eat.[26] Skłodow ska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her keep. In 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an indus trial laboratory of Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, she continued studying at the University of Paris and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second de gree in 1894.[13][26][b] Skłodow ska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry.[26] That same year, Pierre Curie entered her life: it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together.[27] Pierre Curie was an instructor at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution (ESPCI Paris).[13] They were introduc ed by Polish physicist Józef Wierusz- Kowalski, who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz- Kowalski thought Pierre could access.[13][26] Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some"

Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French.[13] Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, Skłodow ska returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family.[26] She was still labouring unde r the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at Kraków University because of sexism in academia.[16] A letter from Pierre convinced her to return to Paris toLife in ParisPierre and Marie Curie in the laboratory, c. 1904pursue a Ph.D.[26] At Skłodowska's insistence, Curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School.[26] A contemporary qui p would call Skłodow ska ""Pierre's biggest discovery"".[16] On 26 July"

In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on w hom she could depend.[16] In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the existence of X-rays, though the mechanism behind their produc tion was not yet unde rstood.[29] In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power.[29] He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.[13][29] She used an innova tive technique to investigate samples.

"Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.[13][29] She used an innova tive technique to investigate samples. Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.[29] Using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduc t electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.[29] She hypot hesized that the radiation w as not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself.[29] This hypot hesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.[29][30] In 1897, her daughter Irène was born. To suppor t her family, Curie began teaching at the École Normale Supérieure.[24] The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a conve rted shed next to ESPCI.[24] The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.[31] They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation expos ure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. ESPCI did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and gove rnments.[24][31][32] Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also know n as chalcolite).[31] Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was"

She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.[31][33] She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive.[29] Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.[24][31] The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own; no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it.

It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved.[34] She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann.[35] Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had publ ished his own finding in Berlin.[36] At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: ""The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals"

She later would recall how she felt ""a passionate desire to verify this hypot hesis as rapidly as possible.""[36] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonne s of the ore.[36] In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announc ing the existence of an element they named ""polonium"", in hono ur of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian).[13] On 26 December 1898, the Curies announc ed the existence of a second element, which they named ""radium"", from the Latin word for ""ray"".[24][31][37] In the course of their research, they also coined the word ""radioactivity"".[13] To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt , the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.[31] Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents"
"December 1898, the Curies announc ed the existence of a second element, which they named ""radium"", from the Latin word for ""ray"".[24][31][37] In the course of their research, they also coined the word ""radioactivity"".[13] To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt , the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.[31] Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.[31] Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.[38] The Curies unde rtook t he arduous task of separating out radium salt by di fferential crystallization. From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.[31][39] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 da ys.[31] Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announc ed that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.[40] In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.[41][42] In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.[24]Pierre and"

Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.[24][46] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.[47] On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.[47][48] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[24] Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.[48] The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the PasteurNobel PrizesAt the first Solvay Conference (1911), Curie (seated, second from right) confers with Henri Poincaré; standing nearby are Rutherford (fourth from right), Einstein (second from right), and Paul Langevin (far right). 1911 Nobel Prize diplomaInstitute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was"

Elected instead was Édoua rd Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.[51] It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the Academy.

Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.[53] When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her hous e and ha d to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the hom e of her friend, Camille Marbo.[50] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming oppos ition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honour ed her a second time,"
"on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her hous e and ha d to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the hom e of her friend, Camille Marbo.[50] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming oppos ition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honour ed her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[16] This award was ""in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.""[54] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing. Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because “the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium” and that “there is no relation be tween her scientific work and the facts of her private life”. She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.

A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by nove list Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.[16] Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French gove rnment to suppor t the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conduc ted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.[49] A month after accepting herCurie in a mobile X-ray vehicle, c. 19151911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton. She returned to her laboratory onl y in December, after a break of about 14 m onths.[54] In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie.[49][54] She was appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founde d in 1914.[55] She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.[49][54][56] During World War I,"

The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.[49][54][56] During World War I, Curie recognised that wounde d soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.[57] She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons,[56] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved.[58][59] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popul arly know n as petites Curies (""Little Curies"").[56] She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914.[56] Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.[49][56] Later, she began training ot her women as aides.[60] In 1915, Curie produc ed hollow needles containing ""radium emanation"", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue.

She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.[60] It is estimated that over a million wound ed soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.[20][49] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.[49] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French gove rnment.[56] Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to dona te her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them.[60] She did buy war bonds , using her Nobel Prize money.[60] She said: I am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess.

Mrs. William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Curie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.[49][62][c] In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States, and the First Lady praised her as an example of a professional achiever who was also a suppor tive wife.[4][64] Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French gove rnment offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused.[64][65] In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine.[49] She also travelled to other"

They pointed out that radium poses a risk only if it is ingested,[78] and speculated that her illness was more likely to have been due to her use of radiography dur ing the First World War.[79] She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband Pierre.[49] Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the Paris Panthéon. Their remains were sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity.[80] She became the second woman to be interred at the Panthéon (after Sophie Berthelot) and the first woman to be honour ed with interment in the Panthéon on her own merits.[12] Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle.[81] Even her cookbooks are highly radioactive.[82] Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxe s, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.[82] In her last year,"

Pearce Williams observes: The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the founda tions of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by w hich cancer could be successfully attacked.[39] If Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere.

To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Curie's role as a feminist precursor.[16] She was know n for her hone sty and m oderate lifestyle.[24][83] Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep.[13][32] She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates.[16] In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific community could do research unhindered.[84] She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutionsLegacyTomb of Pierre and Marie Curie, Panthéon, Paris, 2011 Bust of ""Maria Skłodowska- Curie"", CERN Museum, Switzerland, 2015she was affiliated with rather than to her.[83] She and her husband often refused awards and medals.[24] Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.[16] As one of the most famous scientists, Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of pop c ulture.[85]"

Curie received 25.1 percent of all votes cast, nearly twice as many as second-place Rosalind Franklin (14.2 per cent).[86][87] On the centenary of her second N obel Prize, Poland de clared 201 1 the Year of Marie Curie;[88] and the United Nations declared that this would be the International Year of Chemistry.[89] An artistic installation celebrating ""Madame Curie"" filled the Jacobs Gallery at San Diego's Museum of Contemporary Art.[90] On 7 November, Google celebrated the anniversary of her birth with a special Google Doodle.[91] On 10 December, the New York Academy of Sciences celebrated the centenary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in the presence of Princess Madeleine of Sweden.[92] Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences.[93] Awards that she received include: Nobel Prize in Physics"

"Radium and RadioactivityBy Mme. Sklodowska Curie, Discoverer of Radiumfrom Century Magazine (January 1904), pp. 461-466The discovery of the phenomena of radioactivity adds a new group to the great number of invisible radiations now known, and once more we are forced to recognize how limited is our direct perception of the world which surrounds us, and how numerous and varied may be the phenomena which we pass without a suspicion of their existence until the day when a fortunate hazard reveals them.The radiations longest known to us are those capable of acting directly upon our senses; such are the rays of sound and light. But it has also long been recognized that, besides light itself, warm bodies emit rays in every respect analogous to luminous rays, though they do not possess the power of directly impressing our retina. Among such radiations, some, the infra-red, announce themselves to us by producing a measurable rise of temperature in the bodies which receive them, while others, the ultra-violet, act with specially great intensity upon photographic plates. We have here a ﬁrst example of rays only indirectly accessible to us.Yet further surprises in this domain of invisible radiations were reserved for us. The researches of two great physicists, Maxwell and Hertz, showed that electric and magnetic effects are propagated in the same manner as light, and that there exist “electromagnetic radiations,” similar to luminous radiations, which are to the infra-red rays what these latter are to light.

"radiations were reserved for us. The researches of two great physicists, Maxwell and Hertz, showed that electric and magnetic effects are propagated in the same manner as light, and that there exist “electromagnetic radiations,” similar to luminous radiations, which are to the infra-red rays what these latter are to light. These are the electromagnetic radiations which are used for the transmission of messages in wireless telegraphy. They are present in the space around us whenever an electric phenomenon is produced, especially a lightning discharge. Their presence may be established by the use of special apparatus, and here again the testimony of our senses appears only in an indirect manner. If we consider these radiations in their entirety - the ultra-violet, the luminous, the infra-red, and the electromagnetic - we ﬁnd that the radiations we see constitute but an insigniﬁcant fraction of those that exist in space. But it is human nature to believe that the phenomena we know are the only ones that exist, and whenever some chance discovery extends the limits of our knowledge we are ﬁlled with amazement. We cannot become accustomed to the idea that we live in a world that is revealed to us only in a restricted portion of its manifestations.Among recent scientiﬁc achievements which have attracted most attention must be placed the discovery of cathode rays, and in even greater measure that of Roentgen rays.

"world that is revealed to us only in a restricted portion of its manifestations.Among recent scientiﬁc achievements which have attracted most attention must be placed the discovery of cathode rays, and in even greater measure that of Roentgen rays. These rays are produced in vacuum-tubes when an electric discharge is passed through the rareﬁed gas. The prevalent opinion among physicists is that cathode rays are formed by extremely small material particles, charged with negative electricity, and thrown off with great velocity from the cathode, or negative electrode, of the tube. When the cathode rays meet the glass wall of the tube they render it vividly ﬂuorescent. These rays can be deﬂected from their straight path by the action of a magnet. Whenever they encounter a solid obstacle, the emission of Roentgen rays is the result. These latter can traverse the glass and propagate themselves through the outside air. They differ from cathode rays in that they carry no electric charge and are not deﬂected from their course by the action of a magnet. Everyone knows the effect of Roentgen rays upon photographic plates and upon ﬂuorescent screens, the radiographs obtainable from them, and their application in surgery.The discovery of Becquerel rays dates from a few years after that of Roentgen rays.

The world, attracted by the sensational discovery of Roentgen rays, was less inclined to astonishment. On all sides a search was instituted by similar processes for new rays, and announcements of phenomena were made that have not always been conﬁrmed. It has been only gradually that the positive existence of a new radiation has been established. The merit of this discovery belongs to M. Becquerel, who succeeded in demonstrating that uranium and its compounds spontaneously emit rays that are able to traverse opaque bodies and to affect photographic plates.It was at the close of the year 1897 that I began to study the compounds of uranium, the properties of which had greatly attracted my interest. Here was a substance emitting spontaneously and continuously radiations similar to Roentgen rays, whereas ordinarily Roentgen rays can be produced only in a vacuum-tube with the expenditure of energy. By what process can uranium furnish the same rays without expenditure of energy and without undergoing apparent modiﬁcation? Is uranium the only body whose compounds emit similar rays? Such were the questions I asked myself, and it was while seeking to answer them that I entered into the researches which have led to the discovery of radium.First of all, I studied the radiation of the compounds of uranium.

"body whose compounds emit similar rays? Such were the questions I asked myself, and it was while seeking to answer them that I entered into the researches which have led to the discovery of radium.First of all, I studied the radiation of the compounds of uranium. Instead of making these bodies act upon photographic plates, I preferred to determine the intensity of their radiation by measuring the conductivity of the air exposed to the action of the rays. To make this measurement, one can determine the speed with which the rays discharge an electroscope, and thus obtain data for a comparison. I found in this way that the radiation of uranium is very constant, varying neither with the temperature nor with the illumination. I likewise observed that all the compounds of uranium are active, and that they are more active the greater the proportion of this metal which they contain. Thus I reached the conviction that the emission of rays by the compounds of uranium is a property of the metal itself—that it is an atomic property of the element uranium independent of its chemical or physical state. I then began to investigate the different known chemical elements, to determine whether there exist others, besides uranium, that are endowed with atomic radioactivity—that is to say, all the compounds of which emit Becquerel rays. It was easy for me to procure samples of all the ordinary substances—the common metals and metalloids, oxides and salts. But as I desired to make a very thorough investigation, I had recourse"

It was easy for me to procure samples of all the ordinary substances—the common metals and metalloids, oxides and salts. But as I desired to make a very thorough investigation, I had recourse to different chemists, who put at my disposal specimens—in some cases the only ones in existence—containing very rare elements. I thus was enabled to pass in review all the chemical elements and to examine them in the state of one or more of their compounds. I found but one element undoubtedly possessing atomic radioactivity in measurable degree. This element is thorium. All the compounds of thorium are radioactive, and with about the same intensity as the similar compounds of uranium. As to the other substances, they showed no appreciable radioactivity under the conditions of the test.I likewise examined certain minerals. I found, as I expected, that the minerals of uranium and thorium are radioactive; but to my great astonishment I discovered that some are much more active than the oxides of uranium and of thorium which they contain. Thus a specimen of pitch-blende (oxide of uranium ore) was found to be four times more active than oxide of uranium itself. This observation astonished me greatly. What explanation could there be for it? How could an ore, containing many substances which I had proved inactive, be more active than the active substances of"

This observation astonished me greatly. What explanation could there be for it? How could an ore, containing many substances which I had proved inactive, be more active than the active substances of which it was formed? The answer came to me immediately: The ore must contain asubstance more radioactive than uranium and thorium, and this substance must necessarily be a chemical element as yet unknown; moreover, it can exist in the pitch-blende only in small quantities, else it would not have escaped the many analyses of this ore; but, on the other hand, it must possess intense radioactivity, since, although present in small amount, it produces such remarkable effects. I tried to verify my hypothesis by treating pitch-blende by the ordinary processes of chemical analysis, thinking it probable that the new substance would be concentrated in passing through certain stages of the process. I performed several experiments of this nature, and found that the ore could in fact be separated into portions some of which were much more radioactive than others.To try to isolate the supposed new element was a great temptation. I did not know whether this undertaking would be difﬁcult. Of the new element I knew nothing except that it was radioactive. What were its chemical properties?

Of the new element I knew nothing except that it was radioactive. What were its chemical properties? In what quantity did it appear in pitch-blende? I began the analysis of pitch-blende by separating it into its constituent elements, which are very numerous. This task I undertook in conjunction with M. Curie. We expected that perhaps a few weeks would sufﬁce to solve the problem. We did not suspect that we had begun a work which was to occupy years and which was brought to a successful issue only after considerable expenditure.We readily proved that pitch-blende contains very radioactive substances, and that there were at least three. That which accompanies the bismuth extracted from pitch-blende we named Polonium; that which accompanies barium from the same source we named Radium; ﬁnally, M. Debierne gave the name of Actinium to a substance which is found in the rare earths obtained from the same ore.Radium was to us from the beginning of our work a source of much satisfaction. Demarçay, who examined the spectrum of our radioactive barium, found in it new rays and conﬁrmed us in our belief that we had indeed discovered a new element.The question now was to separate the polonium from the bismuth, the radium from the barium.

This is the task that has occupied us for years, and as yet we have succeeded only in the case of radium. The research has been a most difﬁcult one. We found that by crystallizing out the chloride of radioactive barium from a solution we obtained crystals that were more radioactive, and consequently richer in radium, than the chloride that remained dissolved. It was only necessary to make repeated crystallizations to obtain ﬁnally a pure chloride of radium.But although we treated as much as ﬁfty kilograms of primary substance, and crystallized the chloride of radiferous barium thus obtained until the activity was concentrated in a few minute crystals, these crystals still contained chieﬂy chloride of barium; as yet radium was present only in traces, and we saw that we could not ﬁnish our experiments with the means at hand in our laboratory. At the same time the desire to succeed grew stronger; for it became evident that radium must possess most intense radioactivity, and that the isolation of this body was therefore an object of the highest interest.Fortunately for us, the curious properties of these radium-bearing compounds had already attracted general attention and we were assisted in our search.A chemical factory in Paris consented to undertake the extraction"

We also received certain pecuniary assistance, which allowed us to treat a large quantity of ore. Themost important of these grants was one of twenty thousand francs, for which we are indebted to the Institute of France.We were thus enabled to treat successively about seven tons of a primary substance which was the residue of pitch-blende after the extraction of uranium. Today we know that a ton of this residue contains from two to three decigrams (from four to seven ten-thousandths of a pound) of radium. During this treatment, and as soon as I had in my possession a decigram of chloride of radium recognized as pure by the spectroscope, I determined the atomic weight of this new element, ﬁnding it to be 225, while that of barium is 137.The properties of radium are extremely curious.

The radiation, measured by means of an electroscope, is at least a million times more powerful than that from an equal quantity of uranium. A charged electroscope placed at a distance of several meters can be discharged by a few centigrams of a radium salt. One can also discharge an electroscope through a screen of glass or lead ﬁve or six centimeters thick. Photographic plates placed in the vicinity of radium are also instantly affected if no screen intercepts the rays; with screens, the action is slower, but it still takes place through very thick ones if the exposure is sufﬁciently long. Radium can therefore be used in the production of radiographs.The compounds of radium are spontaneously luminous. The chloride and bromide, freshly prepared and free from water, emit a light which resembles that of a glow-worm. This light diminishes rapidly in moist air; if the salt is in a sealed tube, it diminishes slowly by reason of the transformation of the white salt, which becomes colored, but the light never completely disappears. By redissolving the salt and drying it anew, its original luminosity is restored.A glass vessel containing radium spontaneously charges itself with electricity.

If the glass has a weak spot,—for example, if it is scratched by a ﬁle,—an electric spark is produced at that point, the vessel crumbles like a Leiden jar when overcharged, and the electric shock of the rupture is felt by the ﬁngers holding the glass.Radium possesses the remarkable property of liberating heat spontaneously and continuously. A solid salt of radium develops a quantity of heat such that for each gram of radium contained in the salt there is an emission of one hundred calories per hour. Expressed differently, radium can melt in an hour its weight in ice. When we reﬂect that radium acts in this manner continuously, we are amazed at the amount of heat produced, for it can be explained by no known chemical reaction.The radium remains apparently unchanged. If, then, we assume that it undergoes a transformation, we must therefore conclude that the change is extremely slow; in an hour it is impossible to detect a change by any known methods.As a result of its emission of heat, radium always possesses a higher temperature than its surroundings. This fact may be established by means of a thermometer, if care is taken to prevent the radium from losing heat.Radium has the power of communicating its radioactivity to surrounding bodies.

This fact may be established by means of a thermometer, if care is taken to prevent the radium from losing heat.Radium has the power of communicating its radioactivity to surrounding bodies. This is a property possessed by solutions of radium salts even more than by the solid salts. When a solution of a radium salt is placed in a closed vessel, the radioactivity in part leaves the solution and distributes itself through the vessel, the walls of which become radioactive and luminous.The radiation is therefore in part exteriorized. We may assume, with Mr. Rutherford, that radium emits a radioactive gas and that this spreads through the surrounding air and over the surface of neighboring objects. This gas has received the name emanation. It differs from ordinary gas in the fact that it gradually disappears. [The modern name for this element is radon.]Certain bodies—bismuth, for instance—may also be rendered active by keeping them in solution with the salts of radium. These bodies then become atomically active, and keep this radioactivity even after chemical transformations. Little by little, however, they lose it, while the activity of radium persists.The nature of radium radiations is very complex.

They may be divided into three distinct groups, according to their properties. One group is composed of radiations absolutely analogous to cathode rays, composed of material particles called electrons, much smaller than atoms, negatively charged, and projected from the radium with great velocity—a velocity which for some of these rays is very little inferior to that of light.The second group is composed of radiations which are believed to be formed by material particles the mass of which is comparable to that of atoms, charged with positive electricity, and set in motion by radium with a great velocity, but one that is inferior to that of the electrons. Being larger than electrons and possessing at the same time a smaller velocity, these particles have more difﬁculty in traversing obstacles and form rays that are less penetrating.Finally, the radiations of the third group are analogous to Roentgen rays and do not behave like projectiles.The radiations of the ﬁrst group are easily deﬂected by a magnet; those of the second group, less easily and in the opposite direction; those of the third group are not deﬂected. From its power of emitting these three kinds of rays, radium may be likened to a complete little Crookes tube acting spontaneously.Radium is a body which gives out energy continuously and spontaneously.

From its power of emitting these three kinds of rays, radium may be likened to a complete little Crookes tube acting spontaneously.Radium is a body which gives out energy continuously and spontaneously. This liberation of energy is manifested in the different effects of its radiation and emanation, and especially in the development of heat. Now, according to the most fundamental principles of modern science, the universe contains a certain deﬁnite provision of energy, which can appear under various forms, but cannot be increased.Without renouncing this conception, we cannot believe that radium creates the energy which it emits; but it can either absorb energy continuously from without, or possess in itself a reserve of energy sufﬁcient to act during a period of years without visible modiﬁcation. The ﬁrst theory we may develop by supposing that space is traversed by radiations that are as yet unknown to us, and that radium is able to absorb these radiations and transform their energy into the energy of radioactivity. Thus in a vacuum-tube the electric energy is utilized to produce cathode rays, and the energy of the latter is partly transformed, by the bodies which absorb them into the energy of Roentgen rays. It is true that we have no proof of the existence of radiations which produce radioactivity; but, as indicated at the beginning of this article, there is nothing improbable in supposing that such radiations exist about us without our suspecting it.If we assume"

It is true that we have no proof of the existence of radiations which produce radioactivity; but, as indicated at the beginning of this article, there is nothing improbable in supposing that such radiations exist about us without our suspecting it.If we assume that radium contains a supply of energy which it gives out little by little, we are ledto believe that this body does not remain unchanged, as it appears to, but that it undergoes an extremely slow change. Several reasons speak in favor of this view. First, the emission of heat, which makes it seem probable that a chemical reaction is taking place in the radium. But this can be no ordinary chemical reaction, affecting the combination of atoms in the molecule. No chemical reaction can explain the emission of heat due to radium. Furthermore, radioactivity is a property of the atom of radium; if, then, it is due to a transformation this transformation must take place in the atom itself. Consequently, from this point of view, the atom of radium would be in a process of evolution, and we should be forced to abandon the theory of the invariability of atoms, which is at the foundation of modern chemistry.Moreover, we have seen that radium acts as though it shot out into space a shower of projectiles, some of which have the dimensions of atoms, while others can only be very small fractions"

If this image corresponds to a reality, it follows necessarily that the atom of radium breaks up into subatoms of different sizes, unless these projectiles come from the atoms of the surrounding gas, disintegrated by the action of radium; but this view would likewise lead us to believe that the stability of atoms is not absolute.Radium emits continuously a radioactive emanation which, from many points of view, possesses the properties of a gas. Mr. Rutherford considers the emanation as one of the results of the disintegration of the atom of radium, and believes it to be an unstable gas which is itself slowly decomposed.Professor Ramsay has announced that radium emits helium gas continuously. If this very important fact is conﬁrmed, it will show that a transformation is occurring either in the atom of radium or in the neighboring atoms, and a proof will exist that the transmutation of the elements is possible. [In fact radium does emit helium, as alpha particles.]When a body that has remained in solution with radium becomes radioactive, the chemical properties of this body are modiﬁed, and here again it seems as though we have to"

[In fact radium does emit helium, as alpha particles.]When a body that has remained in solution with radium becomes radioactive, the chemical properties of this body are modiﬁed, and here again it seems as though we have to deal with a modiﬁcation of the atom. It would be very interesting to see whether, by thus giving radioactivity to bodies, we can succeed in causing an appreciable change in their atoms. We should thus have a means of producing certain transformations of elements at will. [These observations were misleading. True artiﬁcial radioactivity was not produced until the work of Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1934.]It is seen that the study of the properties of radium is of great interest. This is true also of the other strongly radioactive substances, polonium and actinium, which are less known because their preparation is still more difﬁcult. All are found in the ores of uranium and thorium, and this fact is certainly not the result of chance, but must have some connection with the manner of formation of these elements. Polonium, when it has just been extracted from pitch-blende, is as active as radium, but its radioactivity slowly disappears; actinium has a persistent activity. These two bodies differ from radium in many ways; their study should therefore be fertile in new results. Actinium lends itself readily to the study of the emanation and of the"

These two bodies differ from radium in many ways; their study should therefore be fertile in new results. Actinium lends itself readily to the study of the emanation and of the radioactivity produced in inactive bodies, since it gives out emanation in great quantity. It would also be interesting, from the chemical point of view, to prove that polonium and actinium contain new elements. Finally, one might seek out still other strongly radioactive substances and study them.But all these investigations are exceedingly difﬁcult because of the obstacles encountered in thepreparation of strongly radioactive substances. At the present time we possess only about a gram of pure salts of radium. Research in all branches of experimental science—physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine—is impeded, and a whole evolution in science is retarded, by the lack of this precious and unique material, which can now be obtained only at great expense. We must now look to individual initiative to come to the aid of science, as it has so often done in the past, and to facilitate and expedite by generous gifts the success of researches the inﬂuence of which may be far-reaching."

"MOULD 74 CURRENT ONCOLOGY—VOLUME 14, NUMBER 2 ABSTRACT The year 2006 marked 100 years since the death of Pierre Curie. It is therefore appropriate that we remem-ber his life and his work, which was cut short by his untimely death from an accident on the Pont Neuf, Paris, on April 19, 1906. He had already accomplished muchduring his life, both before the discovery of radium with Marie Curie, in work co-authored with his brother Jacques on piezoelectricity, and afterwards, when hepublished the results of several experimental studies with radium and radon. He came from a medical fam- ily, and his grandfather Pierre Curie was a famous ho-meopathic physician. He has, in print, unfairly been relegated to the background—his own scientific con- tributions having been overtaken by the fame of MarieCurie, probably because she outlived him by 28 years. KEY WORDS Pierre Curie, piezoelectricity, radium, radioactivity 1. INTRODUCTION Only a single biography 1 has been written on Pierre Curie, as compared with more than ten on Marie Curie. Pierre Curie’s papers were published in 1908 2, after his death, because such publication was thenthe policy in Paris for many famous scientists. Today, it is largely forgotten that the Curie broth- ers discovered piezoelectricity 3–5, a phenomenon that enabled the development of the piezoelectrometer.

THE CURIE FAMILY The Curie family originated from Mulhouse in Alsace before the German annexation of Alsace and Lorraineat the end of the nineteenth century. Pierre Curie’s grandfather, Paul Étienne François Gustave, and fa- ther, Eugène, were physicians. Eugène was brought up in Paris and studied natural sciences and medi-cine at the Musée d’Histoire naturelle at 47 rue Cuvier where, later, Henri Becquerel was to be professor of physics and to discover radioactivity. It was also in ahouse in the rue Cuvier, number 16, that Pierre Curie was born. Later, at 12 rue Cuvier, the Laboratoire Curie was established by the Sorbonne in 1904. Thelaboratory remained on that site until 1914, when the Institut du Radium was built in rue Pierre Curie. Of the first three generations in the family, only Eugène Curie never published. Paul established him- self as a physician in England working at the London Homeopathic Infirmary 8–12 having previously worked as a surgeon in the Military Hospital of Paris (Fig- ure 1).

In the Curie family tree shown in Figure 2, only Eve Curie was not a scientist; however, she was theauthor of the first biography of Marie Curie 13. Maurice and Daniel were both physicists. Hélène is a nuclear physicist, and Pierre, a biochemist. In 1903, Pierre and Marie, with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1911, Marie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In1935, Irène and Frédéric were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1965, Henri Labouisse received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of UNICEF. Starting in 1913, Maurice Curie 14–17 worked for a year with Marie Curie in the Laboratoire Curie in the rue Cuvier, and throughout World War I, he cor-responded with her. He spent 12 months on the front line before 1917, mostly near Verdun, but he survived the war. Son Daniel published with his father 17,18.

Personal commu-nication, October 2003). However, it now transpires that, although the mysterious Alfred was not related to Pierre Curie, he nevertheless existed 21, and in 1911, for his doctorate in medicine from the University of Paris, he submitted a thesis titled Treatment of Spina Bifida 22. He was traced through annual copies of Le Guide Rosenwald, which lists all French doctors and which shows that, in 1912, he was an internist at L’Hôpital de Clichy. Afterwards, he seems to havebeen in general practice, having set up a private clinic. He was born in 1973 and died in Paris in 1940 21. Whether it was really Alfred Curie—or an Egyp- tian pharmacist, Alexis Moussalli—who invented the formula is not known, but nevertheless a formula for Tho-Radia did actually exist 21. For the face cream, the radioactivity consisted of 0.5 g thorium chloride and 0.25 mg radium bromide per 100 g of cream. The Tho- Radia patent (“marque”) was registered by the Tribu-nal de Commerce de la Seine on November 29, 1932. It is probable that the commercial mastermind behind Tho-Radia was Alexis Moussalli.

In 1883, Jacques left to take up the head lectureship in mineralogy at the University of Montpellier.Montpellier being in the south of France and very dis- tant from Paris, Jacques’ move ended the scientific collaboration of the brothers, but not before they hadcompleted important studies on the electric proper- ties of crystals and had discovered piezoelectricity 3–5. In 1883, Pierre also left the Sorbonne. He took charge of all the practical work (Chef de travaux pra- tique) and eventually became Professeur de Physique Générale et Electricité Théorie at the École Supérieurede Physique et de Chimie Industrielles ( ESPCI), which until 1946 was called the École Municipale de Phy- sique et de Chimie Industrielles. He was to remainthere for 22 years, obtaining his Doctor of Science degree in 1895 24. In 1900, he returned to the Sorbonne as a professor in the Faculty of Sciences. As early as the eighteenth century, the crystals of some minerals were known to generate an electric charge when heated; the phenomenon was calledpyroelectricity. The phenomenon of piezoelectricity (named after the Greek piezein, meaning to squeeze or press) was discovered by the Curie brothers whenthey showed that crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt generated electrical polarization under mechanical stress.

Piezoelectricityfrom a thin slice of quartz was the basis for the Curie electrometer. The first practical application of the discovery (after the measurement of radioactivity) was in a so- nar piezoelectric device. This ultrasonic submarine detector was developed in 1917—during WorldWar I—by Paul Langevin, who had been one of Pierre’s students at ESPCI. The device consisted of a transducer (made of thin quartz crystals carefully gluedbetween two steel plates) and a hydrophone to detect the returning echo. The transducer emits a high-fre- quency note of sound. By measuring the time taken tohear the echo of the sound waves returning from an object, the distance to the object can be calculated. 5. THE CURIE POINT Pierre Curie’s name is not only commemorated by the Curie piezoelectrometer, but also by the Curiepoint (or Curie temperature) of ferromagnetic mate- rial. The Curie point is the temperature above which the material loses its characteristic ferromagnetic properties. In an analogy to ferromagnetism, the Curiepoint is also used to describe the temperature above which piezoelectric materials lose their spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric properties. During theperiod 1880–1895, without any collaboration with his brother, Pierre Curie undertook further research into piezoelectricity, crystal symmetry, and the Curiepoint 25–28. 6.

POLONIUM AND RADIUM In 1898, Pierre Curie ceased his studies on piezo-electricity and crystallography to be able to concen-trate solely on working with Marie Curie—a collaboration that culminated in the discovery of polo- nium and radium 6,7. This phase of Pierre’s life is very well documented not only in scientific publications, but also in popular magazines and journals. Invari- ably, the latter were illustrated with not-very-goodrepresentations of Pierre and Marie working together in their rue Lhomond laboratory. In his Nobel address, Pierre Curie made the fol- lowing famous statement: It is possible to conceive that, in criminal hands, radium might prove very dangerous,in their rue Lhomond laboratory. In his Nobel address, Pierre Curie made the fol- lowing famous statement: It is possible to conceive that, in criminal hands, radium might prove very dangerous, and the question therefore arises whether it be to the advantage of humanity to know thesecrets of nature, whether we will be suffi- ciently mature to profit by them, or whether that knowledge may not prove harmful. Take for instance the discoveries of Nobel: Powerful explosives have made it possible to achieve admirable things, but theyare also a terrible means of destruction in the hands of those great criminals who draw na- tions into war."

Take for instance the discoveries of Nobel: Powerful explosives have made it possible to achieve admirable things, but theyare also a terrible means of destruction in the hands of those great criminals who draw na- tions into war. I am among those who be-lieve with Nobel that humanity will obtain more good than evil from future discoveries (Curie P. Radioactive substances, especiallyradium. Presented in Stockholm, June 6, 1905). 7. SELF-EXPOSURE RADIUM BURNS 7.1 Friedrich Walkoff and Friedrich Giesel The first self-exposure experiments were made not by Henri Becquerel, but by two Germans: FriedrichWalkoff and Friedrich Giesel. (Giesel worked for the Buchler company in Brunswick, Buchler being the first producer of radium sources in Germany.) InOctober 1900, Giesel described in a scientific jour- nal the strapping of 270 mg of radium salt to his in- ner forearm for a duration of two hours 29; he also wrote about it to Pierre Curie (Joliot–Langevin H.PIERRE CURIE CURRENT ONCOLOGY—VOLUME 14, NUMBER 277Personal communication, October 2004). The Walkoff reference of 1900 30 consisted of just three lines in a three-page general review (dealing mainly with photographic questions) presented to a photo-graphic club in Munich. The review was published in the October 1900 issue of Photographische Rundschau: Zeitschrift für Freunde der Photo-graphie. The title, translated into English, is “Invis- ible, photographically effective rays.” I am most grateful to Dr. Jean Dutreix, for the translation andcomments"
"1900 30 consisted of just three lines in a three-page general review (dealing mainly with photographic questions) presented to a photo-graphic club in Munich. The review was published in the October 1900 issue of Photographische Rundschau: Zeitschrift für Freunde der Photo-graphie. The title, translated into English, is “Invis- ible, photographically effective rays.” I am most grateful to Dr. Jean Dutreix, for the translation andcomments that follow. Walkoff wrote: Furthermore, radium owns astonishing physiologic properties. An exposure of the arm to two 20-minute sessions has producedan inflammation of the skin which has now lasted already for two weeks, and exhibits the same aspect as that obtained after a long ex-posure to X-rays. Trials still not completed, made in the Munich Hygiene Institute, seem to show an effect on micro-organisms. An interesting question is posed (and answered below) by Dutreix: “Is this a personal experiment, oris he reporting on an experiment made by his friend Friedrich Giesel?” The details are scarce but precise: two exposures of 20 minutes and a skin inflamma-tion now lasting for two weeks. A few lines above his radium comments, Walkoff reports on two of his own photographic experiments. Why not on the skinexperiment, which is so casually presented? The first impression, therefore, is that Walkoff is mentioning an experiment undertaken by someone else. However, the following three points incline us to believe that the two skin trials by Walkoff and Giesel are not connected and that they are two separateexperiments: • Walkoff writes: “Dr. Giesel, out of friendliness, put at my disposal 0.2"
"not on the skinexperiment, which is so casually presented? The first impression, therefore, is that Walkoff is mentioning an experiment undertaken by someone else. However, the following three points incline us to believe that the two skin trials by Walkoff and Giesel are not connected and that they are two separateexperiments: • Walkoff writes: “Dr. Giesel, out of friendliness, put at my disposal 0.2 g of radium much coveted by the physicists [ physiker— physicist, and not physician] for physiologic trials.” • In the description of the reaction “now last[ing] already for two weeks” suggests that Walkoff is acquainted with the follow-up. Is this personalinformation or information from Giesel? • Walkoff pays credit to his “friend Giesel for pro- ducing polonium and radium,” but does not men-tion any physiologic trials undertaken by Giesel. Because Walkoff warmly expresses his gratitude to Giesel, it can be assumed that if he were refer-ring to an experiment by Giesel, he would have had the courtesy to mention this fact. In conclusion, an interesting observation relat- ing to Friedrich Giesel was later published in 1905 31 and clearly shows the hazards of commercially pre- paring the early radium sources: “Giesel’s breath wasso radioactive that it would still discharge an electro- scope 18 hours after he left his laboratory, and Giesel’s body was the most radioactive that had yet been measured.” 7.2 Henri Becquerel and Pierre Curie Becquerel’s radium burn was often reported to have been “accidental” after he had placed a radium source inside his jacket pocket.

However, Becquerel gavecredit for the first observations to Walkoff and Giesel 29,30, and together with Pierre Curie, to whom Giesel had previously written (Joliot–Langevin H.Personal communication, October 2004), Becquerel reported his own self-exposure measurements with radium 32 with a source placed many times in a pocket of his jacket. Marie Curie, in her biography of Pierre Curie 1, describes Becquerel’s reaction to the experience ofreceiving a radium burn: In order to test the results that had just been announced by F. Giesel, Pierre Curie voluntarily exposed his arm to the action of radium during several hours. This resulted ina lesion resembling a burn that developed progressively and required several months to heal. Henri Becquerel had by accident a simi-lar burn as a result of carrying in his vest pocket a glass tube containing radium salt. He came to tell us of this evil effect of ra-dium, exclaiming in a manner at once de- lighted and annoyed: “I love it, but I owe it a grudge.” What now follows is the English translation—He came to tell us of this evil effect of ra-dium, exclaiming in a manner at once de- lighted and annoyed: “I love it, but"

First observa- tions of this action are due to Walkoff andGiesel in 1900. Mr. Giesel applied to his arm for two hours, radiferous radium bromide placed in a celluloid sheet. Radiations actingthrough the celluloid provoked a light red colour of the skin. Two or three weeks later, the red colour increased, and an inflamma-tion of the tissues appeared, and the skin sloughed off. Mr. Curie reproduced on himself the Giesel experiment letting it act for 10 hours on his arm, through a thin sheet of gutta percha, the radiferous barium chloride[“Radiferous barium” is not a misprint forMOULD 78 CURRENT ONCOLOGY—VOLUME 14, NUMBER 2“radiferous radium”; the discovery of radium was associated with the barium extract from pitchblende—hence the term radiferous barium.

After the action of the radiations, the skin became red over a 6-cm 2 surface. The result was similar to that of a skin burn, butthe skin was not painful. After some days, the red colour increased without spreading. On the 20th day, scabs were formed and then anopen wound needing covering up. On the 42nd day, the epidermis started to recover around the wound, reaching the centre, and 52 daysafter the action of the radiations, an area of 1 cm 2 of a grey colouration remained, indi- cating a deeper necrosis. Mr. Becquerel, bringing a small sealed tube of a few decigrams of radiferous barium chloride of a high activity level [800,000 timesthe activity of uranium] underwent the same experiment. The radiferous product was en- closed in a sealed glass tube, and the cylindri-cal volume was about 10–15 mm in length and 3 mm in diameter.

The tube, enclosed in a sheet of paper was inside a small cardboardbox. On April 3 and 4, this small box was placed many times in a pocket of his jacket, the total time being assessed as a 6-hour ex-posure. On April 13, he discovered that the radiations through the tube, the box, and the clothes produced a red spot on the skin whichbecame darker in the next days: marking in red the oblong size of the tube, with an oval shape of 6×4 cm 2. On April 24, the skin sloughed off and then the central part became ulcerated with a discharge. The wound was treated during 1 month with a bandage withoil and calcar. Necrosed tissues sloughed off, and on May 22—that is, 49 days after the ir- radiation—the wound was repaired, leavinga scar marking the position of the tube. During the treatment of the burn, a sec- ond oblong spot appeared on about May 15at the place of the opposite corner of the jacket pocket where the radioactive tube was placed.

The action was dated either at the same dateas the first one, or more likely on April 11, even if it lasted a very short time, no more than one hour. Erythema thus appeared34 days at least after the initial action. Inflam- mation progressed with the aspect of a su- perficial burn. On May 26, the skin began toslough off. With the same care as for the first one, this burn was cured more quickly. Dur- ing the period of observation, on April 10,11, and 12, the same radioactive tube was putin another pocket of the jacket, but enclosed in a lead tube of about 5 mm thickness. The tube was kept in the pocket for 40 hours, and no effect was observed. We can add that Madame Curie, carry- ing in a small sealed tube only a few centi- grams of the same very active substance thatgave the above mentioned lesions, presented with similar burns, although this little tube was enclosed in a thin metallic box. For in-stance, a short action, during less than 30 min- utes, produced 15 days later a red spot which was transformed into a blister similar to thatdue to a superficial burn that takes 15 days to be cured. These facts show that the dura- tion of the lesion’s evolution varies accord-ing to the intensity of the radiation and the duration of the excitation action. After these effects we have described,"

After these effects we have described, we experimented on our hands the different ac- tions during researches with these very ac- tive products. Hands have a general trend tobecome scaly, and the extremities of the fin- gers which held tubes or capsules containing very radioactive products become hard andsometimes very painful.

RESEARCH PAPERS During the period 1900–1906, Pierre Curie published twenty-one papers (Table I), either alone or with co- authors other than Marie Curie. Only one of thesewas with Henri Becquerel 32 (in 1901), and that paper includes the self-exposure experiments described earlier. Those experiments in turn led Pierre Curie toloan some radium to Henri Danlos, a dermatologist at the Hôpital St-Louis, Paris, for the first radium treat- ment in France of (non-malignant) skin disease 37. A second paper on the physiologic action of radon (ra- dium emanation) was published in 1904 38, demon- strating Pierre Curie’s continued interest in radiumand radon therapy. The first two topics in the list from Table I attracted much early interest. In regard to the first paper, twotypes of Becquerel rays, deviable and non-deviable, were initially considered to exist. The former were beta rays, and the latter, alpha rays. However, the alpharays were non-deviable only because the tested mag- netic field was not of sufficient strength for any de- viation to be detected. The second"

However, the alpharays were non-deviable only because the tested mag- netic field was not of sufficient strength for any de- viation to be detected. The second paper referred toreports that radium could induce radioactivity in other materials. However, as Ernest Rutherford later dem-onstrated, that phenomenon, which was common to thorium and thoron and to radium and radon, was at- tributable to an active deposit. In comparison with Table I, Table II lists the top- ics on which Marie Curie published during 1900– 1906. Of a total of thirteen papers, she is the sole author of all of them. This period also included thepublication of her doctoral thesis 35,36. Pierre Curie’s final paper 39 was published on June 25, 1906—some two months after his death.Figure 5 shows Marie and Pierre Curie circa 1906. 9.

He had placed some radium salts in a small tube, and this inside another tube, in which he created a vacuum. Then he began to heat both tubes over an electric furnace,when suddenly at about 2000°F, there came an explosion which shattered the tubes and scattered their precious contents. There wasabsolutely no explanation of this explosion; it was one of the tricks that radium is apt to play on you. Here his face lightened withquite a boyish smile. One demonstration by Pierre Curie for Moffett involved the use of radium to illuminate a page for reading purposes. Moffett recorded it as follows: M. Curie took me into a darkened room where I saw quite plainly the light from the radium tube, a clear glow sufficient to readby if the tube were held near a printed page. And of course this was a very small quantity of radium, about 6 centigram. “We estimate,”said Pierre Curie, “that a decigram of radium will illuminate 15 square inches of surface suf- ficient for reader.” In addition he estimatedthat “a kilogram [2.2 pounds] of radium would illuminate a room 30 feet square with a mild radiance; and the light would be much brighterif screens of sulphide of zinc were placed near the radium, for these are thrown by the metal into brilliant phosphorescence.” 40 Pierre Curie was well aware of the dangers in- volved and concluded, “For some time to come theradium light will only"
"[2.2 pounds] of radium would illuminate a room 30 feet square with a mild radiance; and the light would be much brighterif screens of sulphide of zinc were placed near the radium, for these are thrown by the metal into brilliant phosphorescence.” 40 Pierre Curie was well aware of the dangers in- volved and concluded, “For some time to come theradium light will only be a laboratory wonder.” He also gave an “outside estimate” of the amount of ra- dium then in the world being only 4 g—one third ofan ounce in France, one gram in Germany, less than one gram in the United States, and half a gram in the rest of the world—and that “you could heap it all in atablespoon,” and “a kilogram of radium would cost about 10 million francs, and that radium is worth about 3000 times its weight in pure gold.” (Table III gives the costs of radium for the period 1899– 1938 41–47.) Pierre Curie also mentioned 40 that he had just returned from London, lecturing at The Royal Insti- tution, and that “his hands had become much peeled, and very sore from too much contact with radium,and for several days he had been unable to dress him- self.” Earlier Moffett had also remarked on the bio- logic effect of radium, reporting that “Pierre Curiepulled up his sleeve and showed me a forearm scarred and reddened from fresh healed sores.” 10.TEACHING EXPERIMENT Table I shows the topics of Pierre Curie’s research experiments, but it should be emphasized that hisprofessional"

Figure 6 shows him in 1904 at the lec- ture theatre in the rue Cuvier with glassware from one of his standard experiments. He used this experi-ment to demonstrate for his students the phenomenon of radioactivity. Moffett provides the only full description of this experiment 40, considering that it was “the most strik- ing experiment” performed by Pierre Curie and the “one devised by him to prove the existence of radiumTABLE IIICosts of 1 g radium, 1899–1938 41–47—by comparison, the Hope Diamond was sold in 1909 for US$80,060, the equivalent of US$8,779/g Year Cost Comments 1899 £1000 Buchler Company costs quoted rising to £12,000 by Friedrich Giesel 1902 US$3,000 1904 US$18,6001906 US$50,000 in April US$70,000 in August US$90,000 in December 1914 US$150,000 1921 US$100,000 This was the year that Marie Curie was given 1 g radiumduring her visit to the United States 1933 US$70,0001938 US$25,000–US$30,000 Agreement by a Belgian–Canadian cartel FIGURE 6Pierre Curie teaching in 1904 at the Curie Laboratory, 12 rue Cuvier.PIERRE CURIE CURRENT ONCOLOGY—VOLUME 14, NUMBER 281emanations, a kind of gaseous product (quite differ- ent from the rays) which this extraordinary metal"

The experiment itself was described in these terms: M. Curie constructed an apparatus in which a glass tube R, containing a solution of radium is connected to two glass bulbs, A and B, containing sulphide of zinc. The ex- periment is begun by exhausting the air fromthe two bulbs A and B, by means of air pump connections through the tube E. The air is not exhausted, however, from the tube R, over which the stop-cock F is closed, and within which the emanations have been allowed to accumulate. The room is now darkened, andit is seen that so long as the stop-cock F re- mains closed there is no glow in bulbs A and B, but as soon as the stop-cock F is opened both bulbs shine brilliantly, so that the light is plainly visible at a distance of several hun- dred yards. Now, obviously if this effect weredue to the radium rays, it would be produced whether the stop-cock F were open or closed, since the radium rays pass"
"there is no glow in bulbs A and B, but as soon as the stop-cock F is opened both bulbs shine brilliantly, so that the light is plainly visible at a distance of several hun- dred yards. Now, obviously if this effect weredue to the radium rays, it would be produced whether the stop-cock F were open or closed, since the radium rays pass freely throughglass and need not follow the tube S in order to reach the bulbs A and B. It is therefore clear that the sudden light in the bulbs is due to the passage of some- thing out of the tube R, and through the tube S, that something being kept back by theglass of the bulb R until the stop-cock F is opened. So that we conclude that the emana- tions of radium cannot pass through glass and are a manifestation quite distinct from the raysof radium, which can pass through but do not influence the sulphide of zinc. This point having been established, M. Curie proceeded to the most sensational part of his demonstration, by closing the stop- cock F and then placing the lower bulb B, still radiant, in a vessel G containing liquid air, the result being that the light in the bulb B gradually grew stronger while the light in thebulb A diminished, until presently, all the light seemed concentrated in B and gone from A, the conclusion being that the intense cold of liquid air had produced some change in the emanations, has possibly reduced them"

Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present., [, 28, ], She, hypothesized, that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of, molecules, but must come from the, atom, itself., [, 28, ], This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible., [, 28, ], [, 29, ], In 1897, her daughter, Irène, was born.

"1934, the Joliot-Curies finally made the discovery that sealed their place in scientific history. Building on the work of Marie and Pierre Curie, who had isolated naturally occurring radioactive elements, the Joliot-Curies realised the alchemist's dream of turning one element into another: creating radioactive, nitrogen, from, boron, radioactive isotopes of, phosphorus, from aluminium, and, silicon, from, magnesium, .

By then, the application of radioactive materials for use in medicine was growing and this discovery allowed radioactive materials to be created quickly, cheaply, and plentifully.

Depressed, she begins an affair with her colleague, Paul Langevin, . Although she receives Pierre's professorship at the, Sorbonne, the French nationalist press reports the details of her affair with Langevin and she is harassed by xenophobic mobs due to her, Polish, origins. She returns to the house where she attended the seance and tearfully begs her friend, Loie Fuller, who was there to try to use radium to contact Pierre.

She neglects her health and one day faints during class. Her tutor, Prof. Perot is sympathetic and, finding that she has no friends or family in Paris, invites her to a, soirée, his wife is throwing for a ""few friends"" (primarily professors and their wives). Among the many guests is physicist, Pierre Curie, an extremely shy and absentminded man completely devoted to his work. He allows Marie to share his lab and finds that she is a gifted scientist.

The measurements she takes don't seem to add up, and she decides there must be a third, radioactive, element in the rock in addition to the two she knows are in it. In the midst of discussing this, she discloses offhandedly to Pierre's family that she is pregnant., The physics department at the, Sorbonne, refuses to fund their research without more proof of the element's existence, but allows them to use a dilapidated old shed across the courtyard from the physics building. In spite of its disadvantages, they import eight tons of pitchblende, ore, and cook it down to look for the element they call, radium, . In spite of inability to separate out pure radium, they know something is definitely there, as Marie's hands are being burned.

Marie almost loses her mind, but after the concerned Prof. Perot counsels her, she remembers Pierre's words that if one of them is gone, the other must go on working just the same.

"some of you shall carry on, this scientific work and will keep for your, ambition the determination to make a, permanent contribution to science, M. Curie, Address by, Madame M. Curie, at Vassar College, May 14, 1921, 1, PREFATORY NOTE, In her recent visit to America, Madame Curie, conferred a special honor upon Vassar College by, delivering in the chapel on the evening of May fourteenth, the only extended address which she made in, this country. In a simple, straightforward way she, told the story of her great achievement. One realized, how, closely environed by all the great realities of human, experience, in the face of tremendous difficulties and, with limited resources, she had pursued undaunted her, search for truth., The discovery of radium gave Madame Curie immediate, distinction among scientists on account of the, extremely significant contribution she thereby made to, the great ultimate problem of physical science, the, constitution of matter. The striking properties possessed, by radium gave to its discovery a world-wide, interest, all the more intense because of the hope which, was inspired by the possible healing qualities of the, radiations from this new element., That hope is being realized in large measure. It is, therefore fitting that this address should have been, given by Madame Curie at Vassar and that it should, now be circulated among the members of the college, under the foundation in memory of Ellen S. Richards, who devoted her life to the public health., Edna Carter, Chairman of the Department of Physics., 2, THE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM,"

It is, therefore fitting that this address should have been, given by Madame Curie at Vassar and that it should, now be circulated among the members of the college, under the foundation in memory of Ellen S. Richards, who devoted her life to the public health., Edna Carter, Chairman of the Department of Physics., 2, THE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM, I could tell you many things about radium and radioactivity, and it would take a long time. But as we can not do that, I, shall only give you a short account of my early work about, radium. Radium is no more a baby, it is more than twenty, years old, but the conditions of the discovery were somewhat, peculiar, and so it is always of interest to remember them and, to explain them., We must go back to the year 1897. Professor Curie and I, worked at that time in the laboratory of the school of Physics, and Chemistry where Professor Curie held his lectures. I was, engaged in some work on uranium rays which had been discovered, two years before by Professor Becquerel. I shall tell, you how these uranium rays may be detected.

"you how these uranium rays may be detected. If you take a, photographic plate and wrap it in black paper and then on this, plate, protected from ordinary light, put some uranium salt, and leave it a day, and the next day the plate is developed, you notice on the plate a black spot at the place where the, uranium salt was. This spot has been made by special rays, which are given out by the uranium and are able to make an, impression on the plate in the same way as ordinary light., You can also test those rays in another way, by placing them, on an electroscope. You know what an electroscope is. If, you charge it, you can keep it charged several hours and more, unless uranium salts are placed near to it. But if this is the, case the electroscope loses its charge and the gold or aluminum, leaf falls gradually in a progressive way. The speed with which, the leaf moves may be used as a measure of the intensity of, the rays; the greater the speed, the greater the intensity., I spent some time in studying the way of making good, measurements of the uranium rays, and then I wanted to know, if there were other elements, giving out rays of the same kind., So I took up a work about all known elements, and their compounds, and found that uranium compounds are active and also, 3, all thorium compounds, but other elements were not found, active, nor were their"
"the way of making good, measurements of the uranium rays, and then I wanted to know, if there were other elements, giving out rays of the same kind., So I took up a work about all known elements, and their compounds, and found that uranium compounds are active and also, 3, all thorium compounds, but other elements were not found, active, nor were their compounds. As for the uranium and, thorium compounds, I found that they were active in proportion, to their uranium or thorium content. The more uranium, or thorium, the greater the activity, the activity being an atomic, property of the elements, uranium and thorium., Then I took up measurements of minerals and I found that, several of those which contain uranium or thorium or both, were active. But then the activity was not what I could, expect, it was greater than for uranium or thorium compounds, like the oxides which are almost entirely composed of these, elements. Then I thought that there should be in the minerals, some unknown element having a much greater radioactivity, than uranium or thorium. And I wanted to find and to separate, that element, and I settled to that work with Professor, Curie. We thought it would be done in several weeks or, months, but it was not so. It took many years of hard work, to finish that task. There was not one new element, there, were several of them. But the most important is radium, which could be separated in a pure state., All the tests"
"and I settled to that work with Professor, Curie. We thought it would be done in several weeks or, months, but it was not so. It took many years of hard work, to finish that task. There was not one new element, there, were several of them. But the most important is radium, which could be separated in a pure state., All the tests for the separation were done by the method, of electrical measurements with some kind of electroscope., We just had to make chemical separations and to examine all, products obtained with respect to their activity. The product, which retained the radioactivity was considered as that one, which had kept the new element; and, as the radioactivity was, more strong in some products, we knew that we had succeeded, in concentrating the new element. The radioactivity was, used in the same way as a spectroscopical test., The difficulty was that there is not much radium in a mineral;, this we did not know at the beginning. But we now know, that there is not even one part of radium in a million parts of, good ore. And too, to get a small quantity of pure radium, salt, one is obliged to work up a huge quantity of ore. And, that was very hard in a laboratory., 4, We had not even a good laboratory at that time. We, worked in a hangar where there were no improvements, no, good chemical arrangements.

"a small quantity of pure radium, salt, one is obliged to work up a huge quantity of ore. And, that was very hard in a laboratory., 4, We had not even a good laboratory at that time. We, worked in a hangar where there were no improvements, no, good chemical arrangements. We had no help, no money., And because of that the work could not go on as it would have, done under better conditions. I did myself the numerous, crystalizations which were wanted to get the radium salt, separated from the barium salt with which it is obtained out, of the ore. And in 1902 I finally succeeded in getting pure, radium chloride and determining the atomic weight of the, new element radium, which is 226 while that of barium is only, 137., Later I could also separate the metal radium, but that was, a very difficult work; and, as it is not necessary for the use of, radium to have it in this state, it is not generally prepared, that way., Now, the special interest of radium is in the intensity of its, rays which is several million times greater than the uranium, rays. And the effects of the rays make the radium so important., If we take a practical point of view, then the most important, property of the rays is the production of physiological effects, on the cells of the human organism. These effects may be, used for the cure of several diseases. Good results have been, obtained in many cases. What"

And the effects of the rays make the radium so important., If we take a practical point of view, then the most important, property of the rays is the production of physiological effects, on the cells of the human organism. These effects may be, used for the cure of several diseases. Good results have been, obtained in many cases. What is considered particularly, important is the treatment of cancer. The medical utilization, of radium makes it necessary to get that element in sufficient, quantities. And so a factory of radium was started to begin, with in France, and later in America where a big quantity of, ore named carnotite is available. America does produce many, grams of radium every year but the price is still very high, because the quantity of radium contained in the ore is so small., The radium is more than a hundred thousand times dearer, than gold., But we must not forget that when radium was discovered, no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The, work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific, 5, work must not be considered from the point of view of the, direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the, beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that, a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit, for humanity., But science is not rich, it does not dispose of important, means, it does not generally meet recognition before"

The factories produce, many grams of radium every year, but the laboratories have, very small quantities. It is the same for my laboratory and, I am very grateful to the American women who wish me to, have more of radium and give me the opportunity of doing, more work with it., The scientific history of radium is beautiful. The properties, of the rays have been studied very closely. We know that, particles are expelled from radium with a very great velocity, near to that of the light. We know that the atoms of radium, are destroyed by expulsion of these particles, some of which, are atoms of helium. And in that way it has been proved, that the radioactive elements are constantly disintegrating, and that they produce at the end ordinary elements, principally, helium and lead. That is, as you see, a theory of transformation, of atoms which are not stable, as was believed before, but may undergo spontaneous changes., Radium is not alone in having these properties. Many, having other radioelements are known already, the polonium, the mesothorium, the radiothorium, the actinium. We"

Many, having other radioelements are known already, the polonium, the mesothorium, the radiothorium, the actinium. We know, also radioactive gases, named emanations. There is a great, variety of substances and effects in radioactivity. There is, always a vast field left to experimentation and I hope that we, may have some beautiful progress in the following years. It, is my earnest desire that some of you should carry on this, scientific work and keep for your ambition the determination, to make a permanent contribution to science., M.

"of her husband and herself on radium., PREFACE, It is not without hesitation that I have undertaken to write the, biography of Pierre Curie. I should have preferred confiding this task, to some relative or some friend of his infancy who had followed his, whole life intimately and possessed as full a knowledge of his earliest, years as of those after his marriage. Jacques Curie, Pierre's brother, and the companion of his youth, was bound to him by the tenderest, affection. But after his appointment to the University of Montpellier, he, lived far from Pierre, and he therefore insisted that I should write the, biography, believing that no one else better knew and understood the, life of his brother. He communicated to me all his personal memories;, and to this important contribution, which I have utilized in full, I, have added details related by my husband himself and a few of his, friends. Thus I have reconstituted as best I could that part of his, existence that I did not know directly. I have, in addition, tried, faithfully to express the profound impression his personality made upon, me during the years of our life together., This narrative is, to be sure, neither complete nor perfect. I hope, nevertheless, that the picture it gives of Pierre Curie is not deformed, and that it will help to conserve his memory. I wish, too, that it might, remind those who knew him of the reasons for which they loved him., M. C., CONTENTS, Introduction, CHAPTER, I., The Curie Family."

WILLIAM BROWN MELONEY, Every little while a man or a woman is born to serve in some big way., Such a one surely is Marie Curie. Her discovery of radium has advanced, science, relieved human suffering and enriched the world. The spirit in, which she has done her work has challenged the minds and souls of men., One morning in the spring of 1898, when the United States was going to, war with Spain, Madame Curie stepped forth from a crude shack on the, outskirts of Paris, with the greatest secret of the century literally in, the palm of her hand., It was one of the silent, unheralded great moments in the world's, history., The discovery which had become a fact that morning was no accident. It, was a triumph over hardship and doubting men. It represented years of, patient labor.

"the silent, unheralded great moments in the world's, history., The discovery which had become a fact that morning was no accident. It, was a triumph over hardship and doubting men. It represented years of, patient labor. Madame Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, had wrested, from Mother Earth one of her most priceless secrets., I have been asked to tell why I undertook the Marie Curie Radium, Campaign and how I persuaded Madame Curie to write this book., It is with much hesitancy that I venture to write a preface to this, book. She once chided me, in her gentle way, for an article in which I, had stated facts with some feeling—although the facts praised her., ""In science, "" she said, ""we should be interested in things, not persons."", Madame Curie is the most modest of women. It is only after long, persuasion that she has consented to record the autobiographical notes, contained in this book. Still, so much has been left unsaid, uninterpreted, that I feel an obligation to say a word toward a fuller, understanding of this great and noble character., In 1915 I wrote in my editor's suggestion book: ""Greatest woman's story, in the world—Marie Curie, discoverer of radium."", For the next four years scarcely any writer of prominence went abroad, without a commission from me to bring back the story of Madame Curie., Always they returned with the report: ""She was not to be found, "" or ""She, was at the front somewhere, "" or ""She won't see journalists."" My own,"
"book: ""Greatest woman's story, in the world—Marie Curie, discoverer of radium."", For the next four years scarcely any writer of prominence went abroad, without a commission from me to bring back the story of Madame Curie., Always they returned with the report: ""She was not to be found, "" or ""She, was at the front somewhere, "" or ""She won't see journalists."" My own, letters to Madame Curie brought no reply. I did not know then that great, bags of mail from all parts of the world lay piled up in her laboratory, where there was no secretary, while Madame Curie with her X-ray, apparatus was at the front, relieving suffering and saving lives., In May, 1919, another mission took me to Paris and I resolved to see, Madame Curie myself. My friend, Stéphane Lauzanne, Editor-in-Chief of, Le Matin, said: ""Give it up. Become interested in something else;, she will see no one. She does nothing but work."", I began to ask questions., ""She is very simple and exceedingly retiring, "" said Lauzanne. ""Few, things in life are more distasteful to her than publicity. Her mind is, as exact and logical as science itself. She cannot accept or understand, exaggerations and inaccurate quotations. She cannot understand why, scientists, rather than science, should be discussed in the press. There, are but two things for her—her little family and her work., ""After the death of Pierre Curie, the faculty and officials of the, University of Paris decided to depart from all precedent and appoint a, woman to a"
"science itself. She cannot accept or understand, exaggerations and inaccurate quotations. She cannot understand why, scientists, rather than science, should be discussed in the press. There, are but two things for her—her little family and her work., ""After the death of Pierre Curie, the faculty and officials of the, University of Paris decided to depart from all precedent and appoint a, woman to a full professorship at the Sorbonne. Madame Curie accepted the, appointment and the date was set for her installation., ""It was the history-making afternoon of October 5th, 1906. The members, of the class which had formerly been instructed by Professor Pierre, Curie were seated in one group., ""There was present a large crowd—celebrities, statesmen, academicians, all the faculty. Suddenly through a small side door, entered a woman all in black, with pale hands and high arched forehead., The magnificent forehead won notice first. It was not merely a woman who, stood before us, but a brain—a living thought. Her appearance was, enthusiastically applauded for five minutes. When the applause died, down, Madame Curie bent forward with slightly trembling lips. We, wondered what she was about to say. It was important. It was history, whatever she said., ""In the foreground sat a stenographer, ready to record her words. Would, she speak of her husband? Would she thank the Minister and the public?, No, she began quite simply as follows:, ""'When we consider the progress made by the theories of radio-activity, since the beginning of the Nineteenth Century—' The important thing, to this great woman"
"important. It was history, whatever she said., ""In the foreground sat a stenographer, ready to record her words. Would, she speak of her husband? Would she thank the Minister and the public?, No, she began quite simply as follows:, ""'When we consider the progress made by the theories of radio-activity, since the beginning of the Nineteenth Century—' The important thing, to this great woman is work. Time should not be wasted in idle words. And, so, dispensing with all superficial formality, with no betrayal of the, tremendous emotion which all but overcame her—except by the extreme, pallor of her face and the trembling of her lips—she continued her, lecture in clear, well-modulated tones., ""It was typical of this great soul that she should carry on their work, courageously and without faltering., ""You will see, "" concluded Lauzanne, ""it is useless to try to interrupt, her work for interviews."", Later I met one of Madame Curie's fellow scientists who sympathized with, my desire, but who agreed with Lauzanne that an interview was, impossible. Finally, however, he promised to carry a letter to Madame, Curie., I wrote ten letters and destroyed them. In one I said: ""My father, who, was a medical man, wrote: 'It is impossible to exaggerate the, unimportance of people.' But you have been important to me for twenty, years, and I want to see you a few minutes."", The answer came within an hour. I was to go to the laboratory the next, morning., I had been in Mr. Edison's laboratory a few weeks"
"I said: ""My father, who, was a medical man, wrote: 'It is impossible to exaggerate the, unimportance of people.' But you have been important to me for twenty, years, and I want to see you a few minutes."", The answer came within an hour. I was to go to the laboratory the next, morning., I had been in Mr. Edison's laboratory a few weeks before sailing from, home. Edison is rich in the material things—as he should be. Every, kind of equipment is at his command. He is a power in the financial as well, as the scientific world. In my childhood I had lived near Alexander, Graham Bell; had admired his great house and his fine horses. A short, time before, I had been in Pittsburgh, where the sky is plumed by the, tall smoke stacks of the greatest radium reduction plants in the world., I remembered that millions of dollars had been spent on radium watches, and radium gun sights. Several millions of dollars' worth of radium was, even then stored in various parts of the United States. I had been, prepared to meet a woman of the world, enriched by her own efforts and, established in one of the white palaces of the Champs d'Elysées or some, other beautiful boulevard of Paris., I found a simple woman, working in an inadequate laboratory and living, in a simple apartment on the meager pay of a French professor., As I entered the new building at Number One Rue Pierre Curie, which, stands out conspicuously among"
"by her own efforts and, established in one of the white palaces of the Champs d'Elysées or some, other beautiful boulevard of Paris., I found a simple woman, working in an inadequate laboratory and living, in a simple apartment on the meager pay of a French professor., As I entered the new building at Number One Rue Pierre Curie, which, stands out conspicuously among the old walls of the University of Paris, I had already formed a picture of the laboratory of the discoverer of, radium., I waited a few minutes in the bare little office which might have been, furnished from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Then the door opened and I saw a, pale, timid little woman in a black cotton dress, with the saddest face, I had ever looked upon., Her well-formed hands were rough. I noticed a characteristic, nervous, little habit of rubbing the tips of her fingers over the pad of her, thumb in quick succession. I learned later that working with radium had, made them numb. Her kind, patient, beautiful face had the detached, expression of a scholar. Suddenly I felt like an intruder., I was struck dumb. My timidity exceeded her own. I had been a trained, interrogator for twenty years, but I could not ask a single question of, this gentle woman in a black cotton dress. I tried to explain that, American women were interested in her great work, and found myself, apologizing for intruding upon her precious time. To put me at my ease, Madame Curie began to"
"My timidity exceeded her own. I had been a trained, interrogator for twenty years, but I could not ask a single question of, this gentle woman in a black cotton dress. I tried to explain that, American women were interested in her great work, and found myself, apologizing for intruding upon her precious time. To put me at my ease, Madame Curie began to talk about America. She had for many years wanted, to visit my country, but she could not be separated from her children., ""America, "" she said, ""has about fifty grammes of radium. Four of these, are in Baltimore, six in Denver, seven in New York."" She went on naming, the location of every grain., ""And in France?"" I asked., ""My laboratory, "" she replied simply, ""has hardly more than a gramme."", "", You, have only a gramme?"" I exclaimed. That meant less than, one-twenty-ninth of an ounce., ""I? Oh, I have none, "" she corrected. ""It belongs to my laboratory."", I suggested royalties on her patents. Surely she had protected her right, to the processes by which radium is produced. The revenue from such, patents should have made her a very rich woman., Quietly, and without any seeming consciousness of the tremendous, renunciation, she said, ""There were no patents. We were working in the, interests of science. Radium was not to enrich any one. Radium is an, element. It belongs to all people."", She had contributed to the progress of science and the relief of human, suffering, and yet, in the prime"
"her a very rich woman., Quietly, and without any seeming consciousness of the tremendous, renunciation, she said, ""There were no patents. We were working in the, interests of science. Radium was not to enrich any one. Radium is an, element. It belongs to all people."", She had contributed to the progress of science and the relief of human, suffering, and yet, in the prime of her life she was without the tools, which would enable her to make further contribution of her genius., ""If you had the whole world to choose from, "" I asked impulsively, ""what, would you take?"" It was a silly question, perhaps, but as it happened, a fateful one., ""You ought to have everything in the world you need to go on with your, work, "" I said. ""Some one must undertake this."", ""Who will?"" she asked rather hopelessly., ""The women of America, "" I promised—and then I rose to go., That week I learned that the market price of a gramme of radium was one, hundred thousand dollars. I also learned that Madame Curie's laboratory, although practically a new building, was without sufficient equipment;, that the radium held there was used at that time only for extracting, emanations for hospital use in cancer treatment., I saw Madame Curie at the Institute again and then in her own home—a, small apartment in the Ile St. Louis, where she lived with her two, daughters.

"held there was used at that time only for extracting, emanations for hospital use in cancer treatment., I saw Madame Curie at the Institute again and then in her own home—a, small apartment in the Ile St. Louis, where she lived with her two, daughters. It was a happy, busy little family. They had no protest, against life except to regret that lack of equipment interfered with the, important research work Madame Curie and her daughter, Irene, should, have been doing., It was my hope when I arrived in New York, a few weeks afterwards, to, find ten women to subscribe ten thousand dollars each for the purchase, of a gramme of radium, and in this way to enable Madame Curie to go on, with her work, without the publicity of a general campaign. That hope, was soon dashed. I found one or two such women, but not ten., There were not ten to buy that gramme of radium but there were a hundred, thousand women and a group of men to help, who determined the money must, be raised., My first direct and substantial support came from Mrs. William Vaughn, Moody, widow of the American poet and playwright., When we found it would be necessary to launch a national campaign, Mrs., Robert G. Mead, a doctor's daughter, and one who had been a standby in, cancer prevention work, became secretary, and Mrs. Nicholas F. Brady an, executive member of the committee.

"widow of the American poet and playwright., When we found it would be necessary to launch a national campaign, Mrs., Robert G. Mead, a doctor's daughter, and one who had been a standby in, cancer prevention work, became secretary, and Mrs. Nicholas F. Brady an, executive member of the committee. Behind these women stood a group of, scientific men, who knew what radium had meant to humanity, among them, Dr. Robert Abbe, the first American surgeon to use radium, and Dr., Francis Carter Wood., In less than a year the fund had been raised., Stéphane Lauzanne describes a second impressive moment in the life of, Madame Curie. It was nearly a year after my talk with her. It was, fifteen years since that scene at the University of Paris. These years, had been spent in her laboratory; she had made no public appearance. It, was in March, 1921, that Monsieur Lauzanne heard her voice again., ""I lifted the telephone receiver, "" he relates, ""and heard these words:, 'Madame Curie wishes to speak to you.' What extraordinary, event—what tragedy, perhaps, might this not mean? And suddenly, over the wire came the sound of the voice which I had heard only once, before, but which had stayed in my memory—the same voice which had, once pronounced the words, 'When we consider the progress made by the, theories of radio-activity since the beginning of the Nineteenth, Century——', ""'I wanted to tell you that I am going to America, ' she said. 'It was, very hard for me to decide"
"the voice which I had heard only once, before, but which had stayed in my memory—the same voice which had, once pronounced the words, 'When we consider the progress made by the, theories of radio-activity since the beginning of the Nineteenth, Century——', ""'I wanted to tell you that I am going to America, ' she said. 'It was, very hard for me to decide to go, because America is so far and so big., If some one did not come for me, I should probably never have made the, trip. I should have been too frightened. But to this fear is added a, great joy. I have devoted my life to the science of radio-activity and I, know all we owe to America in the field of science. I am told you are, among those who strongly favor this distant trip, so I wanted to tell, you I have decided to go, but please don't let any one know about it.', ""This great woman—the greatest woman in France—was speaking, haltingly, tremblingly, almost like a little girl. She, who handles, daily a particle of radium more dangerous than lightning, was afraid, when confronted by the necessity of appearing before the public."", A little later, when Madame Curie and I had embarked for America, where, she was to receive her radium and other experimental material, I asked, her if, the day I had first given her the promise, she had believed that, American women would rally to her aid., ""No, "" she confessed honestly, ""but I knew you"
"by the necessity of appearing before the public."", A little later, when Madame Curie and I had embarked for America, where, she was to receive her radium and other experimental material, I asked, her if, the day I had first given her the promise, she had believed that, American women would rally to her aid., ""No, "" she confessed honestly, ""but I knew you were sincere."", About the time of her marriage, one of her relatives gave Madame Curie a, gift of money to be used for a trousseau. It was not a great sum, but, important to the poor student in Paris. To understand the significance, of the use to which she put this fund, it is necessary to remember that, Marie Sklodowska was young, and possessed physical beauty and charm. She, was not without appreciation of the beautiful, and she could not, possibly have been utterly unconscious of her own appearance. She had a, young girl's natural interest in pretty clothes. She considered the, purchase of a wedding gown and other personal belongings, and then, with, her characteristic exactness, measured her needs and the future., She was married in a simple dress she had brought from Poland, and her, trousseau fund was spent on two bicycles, so that she and Pierre Curie, might enjoy the beautiful country of France. That was their honeymoon., One dream that Madame Curie held, and still holds unrealized, is the, hope of a quiet little home of her own with a garden and hedge, and, flowers and birds. During"
"simple dress she had brought from Poland, and her, trousseau fund was spent on two bicycles, so that she and Pierre Curie, might enjoy the beautiful country of France. That was their honeymoon., One dream that Madame Curie held, and still holds unrealized, is the, hope of a quiet little home of her own with a garden and hedge, and, flowers and birds. During her American travels, she would frequently, glance through the window as the train passed through a small town, and, spying some modest little house with a garden, would say, ""I have always, wanted such a little home."", But owning a house was secondary in the life of both Pierre and Marie, Curie. They simply made a home wherever they lived, for such money as, might have gone for the purchase of her little dream house was always, needed in the laboratory. She told me one day, with deep feeling, that, one of the regrets of her life was that Pierre Curie had died without, ever having had a permanent laboratory., She had, as I have said, refused opportunities to come to the United, States because she could not endure separation from her children. She, was, I think, finally persuaded to face the long trip and the terrifying, publicity attending it, partly because of her gratitude for the support, given her scientific work, but principally because it offered a splendid, opportunity for travel to her daughters., There is in Madame Curie none of the legendary coldness and, thoughtlessness attributed to the scientist.

"endure separation from her children. She, was, I think, finally persuaded to face the long trip and the terrifying, publicity attending it, partly because of her gratitude for the support, given her scientific work, but principally because it offered a splendid, opportunity for travel to her daughters., There is in Madame Curie none of the legendary coldness and, thoughtlessness attributed to the scientist. During the war, when she, ran her own radiological truck and lived on the march from hospital to, hospital in the zone of operations, she washed and dried and pressed her, own clothes. Once during our American travels, we stayed in a home where, there were several other house guests besides our party of five. I, entered Madame Curie's room and found her washing her underclothes., ""It is nothing at all, "" she said, when I protested. ""I know perfectly, well how to do it, and with all of these extra guests in the house, the, servants have enough to do."", On the night before the reception at the White House, at which President, Harding was to present the gramme of radium to Madame Curie, the Deed, was brought to Madame Curie. It was a beautifully engraved scroll, prepared in the office of Coudert Brothers, vesting all rights to a, gramme of radium, the gift of American women, in Madame Curie., She read the paper carefully, and then, after a few moments of thought, said: ""It is very fine and generous, but it must not be left this way., This gramme of radium"
"to Madame Curie. It was a beautifully engraved scroll, prepared in the office of Coudert Brothers, vesting all rights to a, gramme of radium, the gift of American women, in Madame Curie., She read the paper carefully, and then, after a few moments of thought, said: ""It is very fine and generous, but it must not be left this way., This gramme of radium represents a great deal of money, but more than, that, it represents the women of this country. It is not for me; it is, for science. I am not well; I may die any day. My daughter Eve is not of, legal age, and if I should die it would mean that this radium would go, to my estate and would be divided between my daughters. It is not for, that purpose. This radium must be consecrated for all time to the use of, science. Will you have your lawyer draw a paper which will make this, very clear?"", I said that it would be done in a few days., ""It must be done to-night, "" she said. ""To-morrow I receive the radium, and I might die tomorrow. Too much is at stake."", And so, late as it was on that hot May evening, after some difficulty, we secured the services of a lawyer, who prepared the paper from a draft, Madame Curie herself had written. She signed it before starting for, Washington., This document read:, ""In the event of my death I give to the Institut du Radium, of Paris, for"
"Too much is at stake."", And so, late as it was on that hot May evening, after some difficulty, we secured the services of a lawyer, who prepared the paper from a draft, Madame Curie herself had written. She signed it before starting for, Washington., This document read:, ""In the event of my death I give to the Institut du Radium, of Paris, for exclusive use in the Laboratoire Curie, the gramme of radium which, was given to me by the Executive Committee of Women of the Marie Curie, Radium Fund, pursuant to an agreement dated the 19th day of May, 1921."", This act was consistent with the whole life of the discoverer of radium;, with the answer she had made to my question a year before:, ""Radium is not to enrich any one. It is an element; it is for all, people."", During her American travels, I repeatedly requested Madame Curie to, write the story of her life. I urged its importance to history and its, influence among students preparing to consecrate their lives to science., Finally she consented. ""But it will not be much of a book, "" she said., ""It is such an uneventful, simple little story. I was born in Warsaw of, a family of teachers. I married Pierre Curie and had two children. I, have done my work in France."", A simple statement, but fraught with what meaning!

"""It is such an uneventful, simple little story. I was born in Warsaw of, a family of teachers. I married Pierre Curie and had two children. I, have done my work in France."", A simple statement, but fraught with what meaning! When most of us shall, have been forgotten, when even the Great World War shall have dwindled, to a few pages in the history books, when Governments shall have fallen, and risen and fallen again, the work of Marie Curie will be remembered., Of her work and her husband's, volumes—veritable, libraries—have been written since that spring morning in 1898, when after an all night vigil in a shack on the outskirts of Paris, she, came forth with the great gift of radium to mankind. Scientists will go, on adding to the bibliography of the marvelous element. But of Marie, Curie herself, the woman, it is unlikely that the world will ever read, more than the brief notes which compose this small book., It is her conviction, her philosophy, that ""In science we should be, interested in things, not persons."", CHAPTER I, THE CURIE FAMILY. INFANCY AND FIRST, STUDIES OF PIERRE CURIE, Pierre Curie's parents, who were educated and intelligent, formed a part, of the, petite bourgeoisie, of small means.

"Pierre Curie's parents, who were educated and intelligent, formed a part, of the, petite bourgeoisie, of small means. They did not frequent, fashionable society, but confined themselves entirely to the, companionship of their relatives and a few intimate friends., Eugène Curie, Pierre's father, was a physician and the son of a, physician. He knew very few kinsmen of his name, and very little about, the Curie family, which was of Alsatian (Eugène Curie was born at, Mulhouse in 1827) and Protestant origin. Even though his father was, established in London, Eugène had been brought up in Paris, where he, pursued his studies in the natural sciences and medicine, and worked as, preparator under Gratiollet in the laboratories of the Museum., Doctor Eugène Curie's remarkable personality impressed all who, approached him. He was a tall man, who in youth must have been blonde, with beautiful blue eyes of a clearness and brilliancy that were, striking even in an advanced old age. These eyes, which had retained a, child-like expression, reflected goodness and intelligence. He had, indeed unusual intellectual capacities, a very live aptitude for the, natural sciences, and the temperament of a scholar., Although he wished to consecrate his life to scientific work, family, responsibilities following his marriage and the birth of two sons forced, him to renounce this desire.

"Although he wished to consecrate his life to scientific work, family, responsibilities following his marriage and the birth of two sons forced, him to renounce this desire. The necessities of life obliged him to, practice his medical profession. He continued, however, such, experimental research as his means permitted, in particular undertaking, an investigation upon inoculation for tuberculosis at a time when the, bacterial nature of this malady was not yet established. His scientific, avocations developed in him the habit of making excursions in search of, the plants and animals necessary to his experiments, and this habit, as, well as his love of Nature, gave him a marked preference for country, life. Until the end of his life he conserved his love for science, and, without doubt, also, his regret at not having been able to devote, himself exclusively to it., His medical career remained always a modest one, but it revealed, remarkable qualities of devotion and disinterestedness. At the time of, the Revolution of 1848, when he was still a student, the Government of, the Republic conferred on him a medal, ""for his honorable and courageous, conduct"" in serving the wounded. He himself had been struck, on February, 24th, by a ball which shattered a part of his jaw. A little later, during a cholera epidemic, he installed himself, in order that he might, look after the sick, in a quarter of Paris deserted by physicians., During the Commune he established a hospital in his apartment (rue de la, Visitation) near which there was a barricade,"
"himself had been struck, on February, 24th, by a ball which shattered a part of his jaw. A little later, during a cholera epidemic, he installed himself, in order that he might, look after the sick, in a quarter of Paris deserted by physicians., During the Commune he established a hospital in his apartment (rue de la, Visitation) near which there was a barricade, and there he cared for the, wounded. Through this act of civism and because of his advanced, convictions he lost a part of his, bourgeois, patronage. At this time, he accepted the position of medical inspector of the organization for the, protection of young children. The duties of this post permitted him to, live in the suburbs of Paris where health conditions for himself and his, family were much better than those of the city., Doctor Curie had very pronounced political convictions. Temperamentally, an idealist, he had embraced with ardor that republican doctrine which, inspired the revolutionaries of 1848. He was united in friendship with, Henri Brisson and the men of his group. Like them, a free thinker and an, anticlerical, he did not have his sons baptized, nor did he have them, practice any form of religion., Pierre's mother, Claire Depouilly, was the daughter of a prominent, manufacturer of Puteaux, near Paris. Her father and brothers, distinguished themselves through their numerous inventions connected, with the making of dyes and special tissues. The family, which was of, Savoy, was caught in the business catastrophe caused by the Revolution, of 1848, and ruined."
"nor did he have them, practice any form of religion., Pierre's mother, Claire Depouilly, was the daughter of a prominent, manufacturer of Puteaux, near Paris. Her father and brothers, distinguished themselves through their numerous inventions connected, with the making of dyes and special tissues. The family, which was of, Savoy, was caught in the business catastrophe caused by the Revolution, of 1848, and ruined. And these reverses of fortune, added to those which, Doctor Curie had experienced during his career, meant that he and his, family lived always in comparatively straightened circumstances, with, the difficulties of existence often renewed. Even though raised for a, life of ease, Pierre's mother accepted with tranquil courage the, precarious conditions which life brought her, and gave proof of an, extreme devotion as she made life easier for her husband and children by, her activity and her good will., If the circumstances in which Jacques and Pierre grew up were modest and, not free from cares, nevertheless there reigned in the family an, atmosphere of gentleness and affection. In speaking to me for the first, time of his parents, Pierre Curie said that they were ""exquisite."", They were, in truth, that. The father's spirit was a little, authoritative—always awake and active. And he possessed a rare, unselfishness. He neither wished nor knew how to profit by personal, relations to ameliorate his condition. He loved his wife and sons, tenderly, and was ever ready to aid all who needed him.

The mother was, slight, vivid in character, and, even though her health had suffered, through the birth of her sons, was always gay and active in the simple, home that she so well knew how to make attractive and hospitable., When I first knew them they lived at Sceaux, rue des Sablons (to-day rue, Pierre Curie) in a little house of ancient construction half concealed, amidst the verdure of a pretty garden. Their life was peaceful. Doctor, Curie went where his duties called him, either in Sceaux or in, neighboring localities. Beyond this he occupied himself with his garden, or his reading. Near relatives and neighbors came to visit on Sundays, when bowling and chess were the favorite amusements. From time to time, Henri Brisson sought out his old companion in his tranquil retreat., Great calm and serenity enveloped the garden, the dwelling, and its, inhabitants., Pierre Curie was born the 15th of May, 1859, in a house facing the, Jardin des Plantes, rue Cuvier, where his parents lived at the time when, his father was working in the Museum laboratories.

"garden, the dwelling, and its, inhabitants., Pierre Curie was born the 15th of May, 1859, in a house facing the, Jardin des Plantes, rue Cuvier, where his parents lived at the time when, his father was working in the Museum laboratories. He was the second son, of Doctor Curie and three and a half years younger than his brother, Jacques. In after life he retained few particularly characteristic, memories of his childhood in Paris; yet he did tell me how vividly, present in his mind were the days of the Commune, the battle on the, barricade so near the house where he then lived, the hospital, established by his father, and the expeditions, on which his brother, accompanied him, in search of the wounded., It was in 1883 that Pierre moved with his parents from the capital to, the suburbs of Paris, living first, from 1883 to 1892, at, Fontenay-aux-Roses, then at Sceaux from 1892 to 1895, the year of our, marriage., Pierre passed his childhood entirely within the family circle; he never, went to the elementary school nor to the lycée. His earliest, instruction was given him first by his mother and was then continued by, his father and his elder brother, who himself had never followed in any, complete way the course of the lycée.

"and was then continued by, his father and his elder brother, who himself had never followed in any, complete way the course of the lycée. Pierre's intellectual capacities, were not those which would permit the rapid assimilation of a prescribed, course of studies. His dreamer's spirit would not submit itself to the, ordering of the intellectual effort imposed by the school. The, difficulty he experienced in following such a program was usually, attributed to a certain slowness of mind. He himself believed that he, had this slow mind and often said so. I think, however, that this belief, was not entirely justified. It seems to me, rather, that already from, his early youth it was necessary for him to concentrate his thought with, great intensity upon a certain definite object, in order to obtain a, precise result, and that it was impossible for him to interrupt or to, modify the course of his reflections to suit exterior circumstances. It, is clear that a mind of this kind can hold within itself great future, possibilities. But it is no less clear that no system of education has, been especially provided by the public school for persons of this, intellectual category, which nevertheless includes more representatives, than one would believe at first sight., Very fortunately for Pierre, who could not, as we can see, become a, brilliant pupil in a lycée, his parents had a sufficiently keen, intelligence to understand his difficulty, and they refrained from, demanding of their son an effort which would have been prejudicial to,"
"school for persons of this, intellectual category, which nevertheless includes more representatives, than one would believe at first sight., Very fortunately for Pierre, who could not, as we can see, become a, brilliant pupil in a lycée, his parents had a sufficiently keen, intelligence to understand his difficulty, and they refrained from, demanding of their son an effort which would have been prejudicial to, his development. If, then, Pierre's earliest instruction was irregular, and incomplete, it had the advantage of not so weighing on his, intelligence as to deform it by dogmas, prejudices or preconceived, ideas. And he was always grateful to his parents for this very liberal, attitude. He grew up in all freedom, developing his taste for natural, science through his excursions into the country, where he collected, plants and animals for his father. These excursions, which he made, either alone or with one of the family, helped to awake in him a great, love of Nature, a passion which endured to the end of his life., Intimate contact with Nature, which, because of the artificial, conditions of city life and of traditional education, few children can, know, had a decisive influence on Pierre's development. Guided by his, father, he learned to observe facts and to interpret them correctly. He, became familiar with the animals and plants of the environs of Paris.

He, became familiar with the animals and plants of the environs of Paris. He, knew which ones could be found at each season of the year in the forests, and fields, the streams and ponds. The ponds in particular had for him, an ever new attraction with their characteristic vegetation and their, population of frogs, tritons, salamanders, dragonflies, and other, denizens of air and water. No efforts to obtain the objects of his, interests seemed too great for him. He never hesitated to take any, animal in his hands in order to examine it more closely. Later, after, our marriage, in our walks together, if I made some objection to letting, him put a frog into my hands, he would exclaim: ""But no, see how pretty, it is!"" He loved always, too, to bring back bouquets of wild flowers, from his walks., Thus his knowledge of natural history progressed rapidly. At the same, time, also, he was mastering the elements of mathematics. His classical, studies, on the contrary, had been much neglected, and it was, principally through general reading that he acquired a knowledge of, literature and history. His father, who was widely cultured, possessed a, library containing many French and foreign works.

"it was, principally through general reading that he acquired a knowledge of, literature and history. His father, who was widely cultured, possessed a, library containing many French and foreign works. Having himself a very, pronounced taste for reading, he was able to communicate it to his son., When he was about fourteen years old, a very happy event occurred in, Pierre's education. He was put under an excellent professor, A. Bazille, who taught him elementary and advanced mathematics. This master was able, to appreciate his young pupil, became much attached to him, and directed, his work with the greatest solicitude. He even helped him to advance in, his study of Latin, in which he was very much behind. At the same time, Pierre and Albert Bazille, his professor's son, became friends., This teaching had, I am sure, a great influence on the mind of Pierre, aiding him to develop and to sound the depth of his faculties and to, realize his capacities for science. He had a remarkable aptitude for, mathematics, which expressed itself chiefly by a characteristic, geometric spirit and a great power of spatial vision. He, therefore, progressed rapidly and joyfully in his studies under M. Bazille, for, whom he always felt an unalterable gratitude., He once told me something which proved that even at this time he was not, content solely to follow a fixed program of studies, but that he had, already begun to launch out into personal investigation.

"joyfully in his studies under M. Bazille, for, whom he always felt an unalterable gratitude., He once told me something which proved that even at this time he was not, content solely to follow a fixed program of studies, but that he had, already begun to launch out into personal investigation. Strongly, attracted by the theory of determinants, which he had just mastered, he, undertook to realize an analogous conception, but in three dimensions, and endeavored to discover the properties and uses of these ""cubical, determinants."" Needless to say that at his age, and with the knowledge, then at his disposal, such an enterprise was beyond his powers. The, attempt, however, was none the less indicative of his awakening, inventive spirit., Several years later, when preoccupied with reflections upon symmetry, he, asked himself the question: ""Could not one find a general method for the, solution of any equation whatever? Everything is a question of, symmetry."" He did not then know of Galois' theory of groups which had, made it possible to attack this problem. But he was happy later to learn, its results in the geometric applications to the case of equations of, the 5th degree., Thanks to his rapid progress in mathematics and physics, Pierre Curie, was made a bachelor of science at the age of sixteen years.

"of, the 5th degree., Thanks to his rapid progress in mathematics and physics, Pierre Curie, was made a bachelor of science at the age of sixteen years. With this he, passed his most difficult stage of formal education. The only thing with, which he had to concern himself in the future was the acquisition of, knowledge through his personal and independent effort in a field of, science freely chosen., CHAPTER II, DREAMS OF YOUTH. FIRST SCIENTIFIC WORK., DISCOVERY OF PIEZO-ELECTRICITY, Pierre Curie was still very young when he began his higher studies in, preparation for the licentiate in physics. He followed the lectures and, laboratory work at the Sorbonne and had, besides, access to the, laboratory of Professor Leroux in the School of Pharmacy, where he, assisted in the preparation of the physics courses. At the same time he, became further acquainted with laboratory methods by working with his, brother Jacques, who was then preparator of chemistry courses under, Riche and Jungfleisch., Pierre received his licentiate in physical sciences at the age of, eighteen. During his studies he had attracted the attention of Desains, director of the University laboratory, and of Mouton, assistant director, of the same laboratory. Thanks to their appreciation he was appointed, when only nineteen years old, preparator for Desains and placed in, charge of the students' laboratory work in physics. He held this, position five years, and it was during this time that he began his, experimental research., It is to be regretted that because of his financial situation Pierre was, obliged,"
"assistant director, of the same laboratory. Thanks to their appreciation he was appointed, when only nineteen years old, preparator for Desains and placed in, charge of the students' laboratory work in physics. He held this, position five years, and it was during this time that he began his, experimental research., It is to be regretted that because of his financial situation Pierre was, obliged, at this early age of nineteen, to accept the post of preparator, instead of being able to give his whole time for two or three years, longer to his University studies. With his time thus absorbed by his, professional duties and his investigations he had to give up following, the lectures in higher mathematics, and he therefore passed no further, examinations. In compensation, however, he was released from military, service in conformity with the privileges at that time accorded young, men who undertook to serve as teachers in the public-school system., He was by this time a tall and slender young man with chestnut-colored, hair and a shy and reserved expression. At the same time his youthful, face mirrored a profound inner life. One has such an impression of him, as he appears in a good group photograph of Doctor Curie's family. His, head is resting on his hand in a pose of abstraction and reverie, and, one cannot but be struck by the expression of the large, limpid eyes, that seem to be following some inner vision.

His, head is resting on his hand in a pose of abstraction and reverie, and, one cannot but be struck by the expression of the large, limpid eyes, that seem to be following some inner vision. Beside him the brown-haired, brother offers a striking contrast, his vivacious eyes and whole, appearance suggesting decision., The two brothers loved each other tenderly and lived as good comrades, being accustomed to work together in the laboratory and walk together in, their free hours. They also kept up affectionate relations with a few of, their childhood friends: Louis Depouilly, their cousin, who became a, physician; Louis Vauthier, also later a physician; and Albert Bazille, who became an engineer in the post and telegraph service., Pierre used to tell me of the vivid memories he had of the vacations, passed at Draveil on the Seine, where, with his brother Jacques, he took, long walks beside the river, agreeably interrupted by swimming and, diving in the stream. Both brothers were excellent swimmers. Sometimes, they tramped for entire days. They had, at an early age, acquired the, habit of visiting the suburbs of Paris on foot. At times also Pierre, made solitary excursions which well suited his meditative spirit. On, these occasions he lost all sense of time, and went to the extreme limit, of his physical forces.

On, these occasions he lost all sense of time, and went to the extreme limit, of his physical forces. Absorbed in delightful contemplation of the, things about him, he was not conscious of material difficulties., On the pages of a diary written in 1879, [1], he thus expressed the, salutary influence of the country upon him:, ""Oh, what a good time I have passed there in that gracious solitude, so, far from the thousand little worrying things that torment me in Paris., No, I do not regret my nights passed in the woods, and my solitary days., If I had the time I would let myself recount all my musings. I would, also describe my delicious valley, filled with the perfume of aromatic, plants, the beautiful mass of foliage, so fresh and so humid, that hung, over the Bièvre, the fairy palace with its colonnades of hops, the, stony hills, red with heather, where it was so good to be. Oh, I shall, remember always with gratitude the forest of the Minière; of all the, woods I have seen, it is this one that I have loved most and where I, have been happiest. Often in the evening I would start out and ascend, again this valley, and I would return with twenty ideas in my head."", Thus, for Pierre Curie, the sensation of well-being he experienced in, the country was derived"
"forest of the Minière; of all the, woods I have seen, it is this one that I have loved most and where I, have been happiest. Often in the evening I would start out and ascend, again this valley, and I would return with twenty ideas in my head."", Thus, for Pierre Curie, the sensation of well-being he experienced in, the country was derived from the opportunity for tranquil reflection., Daily life in Paris with its numerous interruptions did not permit of, undisturbed concentration, and this was to him a cause of inquietude and, suffering. He felt himself destined for scientific research; for him the, necessity was imperative of comprehending the phenomena of Nature in, order to form a satisfactory theory to explain them. But when trying to, fix his mind on some problem he had frequently to turn aside because of, the multiplicity of futile things that disturbed his reflections and, plunged him into discouragement., Under the heading, ""A day like too many others, "" he enumerated in his, diary a list of the puerile happenings that had completely filled one of, his days, leaving no time for useful work. He then concluded: ""There is, my day, and I have accomplished nothing. Why?"" Further on he returns to, the same theme under a title borrowed from Victor Hugo's ""Le Roi, S'Amuse, "", ""To deafen with little bells the spirit that would think."", ""In order that, weak one that I am, I shall not let my head turn with, all the winds, yielding to the least"
"then concluded: ""There is, my day, and I have accomplished nothing. Why?"" Further on he returns to, the same theme under a title borrowed from Victor Hugo's ""Le Roi, S'Amuse, "", ""To deafen with little bells the spirit that would think."", ""In order that, weak one that I am, I shall not let my head turn with, all the winds, yielding to the least breath that touches it, it is, necessary that all should be immobile about me, or that, like a spinning, top, movement alone should render me insensible to external objects., ""When, in the process of turning slowly upon myself, I try to gain, momentum, a nothing, a word, a story, a paper, a visit stops me and is, able to put off or retard forever the moment when, granted a sufficient, swiftness I might have, in spite of my surroundings, concentrated on my, own intention.... We must eat, drink, sleep, be idle, love, touch the, sweetest things of life and yet not succumb to them. It is necessary, that, in doing all this, the higher thoughts to which one is dedicated, remain dominant and continue their unmoved course in our poor heads. It, is necessary to make a dream of life, and to make of a dream a reality."", This acute analysis, sufficiently surprising in a young man of twenty, years, suggests in an admirable manner the conditions necessary to the, highest manifestations of the intellect.

"our poor heads. It, is necessary to make a dream of life, and to make of a dream a reality."", This acute analysis, sufficiently surprising in a young man of twenty, years, suggests in an admirable manner the conditions necessary to the, highest manifestations of the intellect. It carries a lesson which, if, it were sufficiently understood, would facilitate the way of all, contemplative spirits capable of opening new paths for humanity., The unity of thought toward which Pierre Curie strove was troubled not, only by professional and social obligations but also by his tastes, which urged him towards a broad literary and artistic culture. Like his, father, he loved reading, and did not fear to undertake arduous literary, tasks. To some criticism made in this connection, he responded readily:, ""I do not dislike tedious books."" This meant that he was fascinated by, the search after truth which is sometimes associated with writing devoid, of charm. He also loved painting and music, and went gladly to look at, pictures or to attend a concert. A few fragments of poetry in his, handwriting were left among his papers., But all these preoccupations were subordinated in his mind to what he, considered his true task, and when his scientific imagination was not in, full activity, he felt himself, in a sense, an incomplete being. He, expressed this inquietude with an emotion born of his suffering during, momentary periods of depression., ""What shall I become?"" he wrote. ""Very rarely have I command of all, myself; ordinarily a part of"
"subordinated in his mind to what he, considered his true task, and when his scientific imagination was not in, full activity, he felt himself, in a sense, an incomplete being. He, expressed this inquietude with an emotion born of his suffering during, momentary periods of depression., ""What shall I become?"" he wrote. ""Very rarely have I command of all, myself; ordinarily a part of me sleeps. My poor spirit, are you then so, weak that you cannot control my body? Oh, my thoughts, you count indeed, for very little! I should have the greatest confidence in the power of, my imagination to pull me out of the rut, but I greatly fear that my, imagination is dead."", But despite hesitations, doubts, and lost moments, the young man was, little by little striking out his path and strengthening his will. He, was resolutely carrying on fruitful investigations at an age when many, men who were to become savants were as yet only pupils., His first work, done in collaboration with Desains, concerned the, determination of the lengths of heat waves with the aid of a, thermoelectric element and a metallic wire grating, a process, then, entirely new, which has since often been employed in the study of this, question., Following this he undertook an investigation on crystals in, collaboration with his brother, who had passed his licentiate and was, preparator for Friedel in the laboratory of mineralogy at the Sorbonne., Their experiments led the two young physicists to a great success: the, discovery of the hitherto unknown"
"process, then, entirely new, which has since often been employed in the study of this, question., Following this he undertook an investigation on crystals in, collaboration with his brother, who had passed his licentiate and was, preparator for Friedel in the laboratory of mineralogy at the Sorbonne., Their experiments led the two young physicists to a great success: the, discovery of the hitherto unknown phenomena of piezo-electricity, which, consists of an electric polarization produced by the compression or the, expansion of crystals in the direction of the axis of symmetry. This was, by no means a chance discovery. It was the result of much reflection on, the symmetry of crystalline matter, which enabled the brothers to, foresee the possibilities of such polarization. The first part of the, investigation was made in Friedel's laboratory. With an experimental, skill rare at their age, the young men succeeded in making a complete, study of the new phenomenon, established the conditions of symmetry, necessary to its production in crystals, and stated its remarkably, simple quantitative laws, as well as its absolute magnitude for certain, crystals. Several well-known scientists of other nations (Roentgen, Kundt, Voigt, Riecke) have made further investigations along this new, road opened by Jacques and Pierre Curie., The second part of the work, and much more difficult to realize, experimentally, concerned the compression resulting in piezo-electric, crystals when they are exposed to the action of an electric field. This, phenomenon, foreseen by Lippmann, was demonstrated by the Curie, brothers. The difficulty of the experiment lay in the minuteness"
"made further investigations along this new, road opened by Jacques and Pierre Curie., The second part of the work, and much more difficult to realize, experimentally, concerned the compression resulting in piezo-electric, crystals when they are exposed to the action of an electric field. This, phenomenon, foreseen by Lippmann, was demonstrated by the Curie, brothers. The difficulty of the experiment lay in the minuteness of the, deformations that had to be observed. Fortunately Desains and Mouton, placed a small room adjoining the physics laboratory at the disposal of, the brothers so that they might proceed successfully with their delicate, operations., From these researches, as much theoretical as experimental, they, immediately deduced a practical application, in the form of a new, apparatus, a piezo-electric quartz electrometer, which measures in, absolute terms small quantities of electricity, as well as electric, currents of low intensity. This apparatus has since then rendered great, service in experiments in radioactivity., [2], During the course of their experiments on piezo-electricity the Curies, were obliged to employ electrometric apparatus, and, not being able to, use the quadrant electrometer known at that time, they developed a new, form of that instrument, better adapted to their necessities. This, became known in France as the Curie electrometer. Thus these years of, collaboration between the two brothers, always intimately united, proved, both happy and fruitful. Their devotion and their common interest in, science were to them both a stimulant and a support. During their work, the vivacity and energy of Jacques were of precious aid to Pierre, always"

Their devotion and their common interest in, science were to them both a stimulant and a support. During their work, the vivacity and energy of Jacques were of precious aid to Pierre, always more easily absorbed by his thoughts., However, this beautiful and close collaboration lasted only a few years., In 1883, Pierre and Jacques were obliged to separate; Jacques left for, the University of Montpellier as Head Lecturer in Mineralogy (, Maître de, Conferences, ). Pierre was made Director of Laboratory Work in the School, of Industrial Physics and Chemistry founded by the city of Paris at the, suggestion of Friedel and of Schützenberger, who became its first, director. Their remarkable researches with crystals won for the brothers, in 1895—very late, it is true—the Planté prize., [1], Pierre Curie did not leave a veritable diary but only a few, pages as chance permitted, covering but a short period of his life., [2], The piezo-electric property of quartz has recently had an, important application; it has been utilized by P. Langevin in the, production of elastic waves of high frequency (beyond sound) sent out in, water with the aim of detecting submarine obstacles. This same method, can serve in a more general manner to explore ocean depths. We see, here, once again, how pure speculation can lead to discoveries that will, be useful later in"

INVESTIGATIONS OF MAGNETISM, It was in the School of Physics, in the old buildings of the Collège, Rollin, that Pierre Curie was destined to work, first as Director of, Laboratory Work, then as Professor, for twenty-two years, a period, covering practically the whole of his scientific life. His memory seemed, to cling to these old buildings, now destroyed, in which he had passed, all his days, returning only in the evening to his parents in the, country. He counted himself fortunate since he enjoyed the favor of the, Founder-Director Schützenberger, and the esteem and good will of his, students, many of whom became his disciples and friends. In alluding to, this experience, at the close of an address delivered at the Sorbonne, near the end of his life, he said:, ""I desire to recall here that we have made all our investigations in the, School of Physics and Chemistry of the city of Paris. In all creative, scientific work the influence of the surroundings in which one works"
"disciples and friends. In alluding to, this experience, at the close of an address delivered at the Sorbonne, near the end of his life, he said:, ""I desire to recall here that we have made all our investigations in the, School of Physics and Chemistry of the city of Paris. In all creative, scientific work the influence of the surroundings in which one works is, of great importance, and a part of the result is due to that influence., For more than twenty years I have worked in the School of Physics and, Chemistry. Schützenberger, the first director of the School, was an, eminent scientist. I remember with gratitude that he procured for me, opportunities for my own investigations when I was yet but an assistant., Later, he permitted Madame Curie to work beside me, an authorization, which was at that time far from an ordinary innovation., ""Schützenberger allowed us all great liberty; his direction made itself, felt chiefly through his inspiring love of science. The professors of, the School of Physics and Chemistry, and the students who have gone from, it, have created a kindly and stimulating atmosphere that has been, extremely helpful to me. It is among the old students of the school that, we have found our collaborators and our friends. I am happy to be able, here, to thank them all."", The newly appointed director of the laboratory was, when he first, assumed his duties, scarcely older than his students, who loved him, because of his extreme simplicity of manner, which was"
"extremely helpful to me. It is among the old students of the school that, we have found our collaborators and our friends. I am happy to be able, here, to thank them all."", The newly appointed director of the laboratory was, when he first, assumed his duties, scarcely older than his students, who loved him, because of his extreme simplicity of manner, which was much more that of, a comrade than of a master. Some of these students recall with emotion, their work carried on with him and his discussion at the blackboard, where he readily allowed himself to be led to debate scientific matters, to their great profit both in information and in kindled enthusiasm. At, a dinner given in 1903 by the Association of Former Students of the, School, which he attended, he laughingly recalled an incident of this, period. One day after lingering late with several students in the, laboratory, he found the door locked, and they all had to climb down, from the first floor single file, along a pipe that ran near one of the, windows., Because of his reserve and shyness he did not make acquaintances easily, but those whose work brought them near him loved him because of his, kindliness. This was true of his subordinates during his entire life. In, the school his laboratory helper, whom he had aided under trying, circumstances, thought of him with the greatest gratitude, in fact, with, veritable adoration., Although separated from his brother, he remained bound to him by their, former bond"
"easily, but those whose work brought them near him loved him because of his, kindliness. This was true of his subordinates during his entire life. In, the school his laboratory helper, whom he had aided under trying, circumstances, thought of him with the greatest gratitude, in fact, with, veritable adoration., Although separated from his brother, he remained bound to him by their, former bond of love and confidence. During vacations, Jacques Curie, would come to him that they might renew again that valuable, collaboration to which both willingly sacrificed their periods of, liberty. At times it was Pierre who joined Jacques, who was engaged in, making a geological chart of the Auvergne country, and there they, covered together the daily distances necessary to the tracing of such a, map., Here are a few memories of these long walks, extracts from a letter, written to me shortly before our marriage:, ""I have been very happy to pass a little time with my brother. We have, been far from all immediate care, and so isolated by our manner of, living that we have not even been able to receive a letter, never, knowing one night where we would sleep the next. At times it seemed to, me that we had gone back to the days when we lived entirely together., Then we always arrived at the same opinions about all things, with the, result that it was no longer necessary for us to speak in order to, understand each other. This was all the more astonishing because we,"
"night where we would sleep the next. At times it seemed to, me that we had gone back to the days when we lived entirely together., Then we always arrived at the same opinions about all things, with the, result that it was no longer necessary for us to speak in order to, understand each other. This was all the more astonishing because we, differed so entirely in character."", From the point of view of scientific investigation, one must recognize, that the nomination of Pierre Curie to the School of Physics and, Chemistry retarded from the very first his experimental research., Indeed, at the time of his appointment nothing yet existed in that, establishment; everything had to be created. Even the walls and the, partitions were hardly yet in place. He had, therefore, to organize, completely the laboratory and its work, and he acquitted himself of this, task in a remarkable manner, injecting into it the spirit of precision, and originality so characteristic of him., The direction of the laboratory work of the large number of students, (thirty by promotion) was alone a strain on a young man, assisted as he, was only by one laboratory helper. The first years were, therefore, hard, years of assiduous work, of benefit chiefly to the students trained and, developed by the young laboratory director., He himself profited by this enforced interruption of his experimental, research by trying to complete his scientific studies and, in, particular, his knowledge of mathematics.

The first years were, therefore, hard, years of assiduous work, of benefit chiefly to the students trained and, developed by the young laboratory director., He himself profited by this enforced interruption of his experimental, research by trying to complete his scientific studies and, in, particular, his knowledge of mathematics. At the same time he became, engrossed in considerations of a theoretical nature on the relations, between crystallography and physics., In 1884 he published a memoir on questions of the order and repetition, that are at the base of the study of the symmetry of crystals. This was, followed in the same year by a more general treatment of the same, subject. Another article on symmetry and its repetitions appeared in, 1885. In that year he published, too, a very important theoretical, work, [3], on the formation of crystals, and the capillary constants of, the different faces., This rapid succession of investigations shows how completely engrossed, Pierre Curie was in the subject of the physics of crystals. Both his, theoretical and his experimental research in this domain grouped itself, around a very general principle, the principle of symmetry, that he had, arrived at step by step, and which he only definitely enunciated in, memoirs published between the years 1893 and 1895., The following is the form, already classic, in which he made his, announcement:, ""When certain causes produce certain effects, the elements of symmetry, in the causes ought to reappear in the effects produced., ""When certain effects reveal a certain dissymmetry, this"
"that he had, arrived at step by step, and which he only definitely enunciated in, memoirs published between the years 1893 and 1895., The following is the form, already classic, in which he made his, announcement:, ""When certain causes produce certain effects, the elements of symmetry, in the causes ought to reappear in the effects produced., ""When certain effects reveal a certain dissymmetry, this dissymmetry, should be apparent in the causes which have given them birth., ""The converse of these two statements does not hold, at least, practically; that is to say, the effects produced can be more, symmetrical than their causes."", The capital importance of this statement, perfect in its simplicity, lies in the fact that the elements of symmetry which it introduces are, related to all the phenomena of physics without exception., Guided by an exhaustive study of the groups of symmetry which might, exist in nature, Pierre Curie showed how one should use this revelation, in character at once geometric and physical, in order to foresee whether, a particular phenomenon can reproduce itself, or whether its, reproduction is impossible under the given conditions. At the beginning, of a certain memoir, he insists in these terms:, ""I think it is necessary to introduce into physics the ideas of symmetry, familiar to crystallographers."", His work in this field is fundamental, and even though he was led away, from it later by other investigations, he always retained a passionate, interest in the physics of crystals, as well as in projects of further, research in this domain.,"
"memoir, he insists in these terms:, ""I think it is necessary to introduce into physics the ideas of symmetry, familiar to crystallographers."", His work in this field is fundamental, and even though he was led away, from it later by other investigations, he always retained a passionate, interest in the physics of crystals, as well as in projects of further, research in this domain., The principle of symmetry to which Pierre Curie had so eagerly devoted, himself is one of the small number of great principles which dominate, the study of the phenomena of physics, and which, having their root in, ideas derived by experiment, yet little by little detach themselves and, assume a form more and more general and more and more perfect. It is in, this way that the idea of the equivalence of heat and of work, added to, the earlier notion of the equivalence of kinetic and potential energies, brought about the establishment of the principle of the conservation of, energy whose application is entirely general. In the same way the law of, the conservation of mass grew out of the experiments of Lavoisier, which, belong to the foundations of chemistry. Recently an admirable synthesis, has made it possible for us to attain a still higher degree of, generalization through the union of these two principles, for it has, been proved that the mass of a body is proportional to its internal, energy.

Recently an admirable synthesis, has made it possible for us to attain a still higher degree of, generalization through the union of these two principles, for it has, been proved that the mass of a body is proportional to its internal, energy. The study of electrical phenomena led Lippmann to announce the, general law of the conservation of electricity. The principle of Carnot, born of considerations on the functioning of thermal machines, has, acquired also so general a significance, that it made possible the, foreseeing of the most probable character of spontaneous evolution for, all material systems., The principle of symmetry furnishes an example of an analogous, evolution. To begin with, observation of Nature was able to suggest the, idea of symmetry; though such observations reveal only imperfectly any, regular dispositions in the aspects of animals and plants. The, regularity becomes very much more perfect in the case of crystallized, minerals. We may consider that Nature furnishes us the idea of a plane, of symmetry and of an axis of symmetry. An object possesses a plane of, symmetry, or a plane of reflection, if this plane divides the object, into two parts, of which each one may be thought of as the image of the, other reflected in the plane as in a mirror. It is this, approximately, that occurs in the external appearance of man and of numerous animals., An object possesses an axis of symmetry of the order, n, if it, preserves the same appearance after a rotation on this axis"
"into two parts, of which each one may be thought of as the image of the, other reflected in the plane as in a mirror. It is this, approximately, that occurs in the external appearance of man and of numerous animals., An object possesses an axis of symmetry of the order, n, if it, preserves the same appearance after a rotation on this axis of the nth, part of a revolution. Thus a regular flower of four petals has an axis, of symmetry of the order four, or a quarternary axis. Crystals like those, of rock salt or of alum possess many planes of symmetry and many axes of, symmetry of different orders., Geometry teaches us to study the elements of symmetry of a limited, figure such, for instance, as a polyhedron; and to discover the, relations between its parts which permit us to reunite different, symmetries in groups. The knowledge of these groups is of the greatest, usefulness in establishing a rational classification of crystal forms in, a small number of systems each of which is derived from a simple, geometric form. Thus the regular octahedron belongs to the same system, as the cube, for in the case of each the group formed by the axes and, the planes of symmetry is the same., In the study of the physical properties of crystalline matter it is, necessary to take account of the symmetry of such matter. This is, in, general, anisotropic, ; that is to say, it has not the same properties, in all directions."
"as the cube, for in the case of each the group formed by the axes and, the planes of symmetry is the same., In the study of the physical properties of crystalline matter it is, necessary to take account of the symmetry of such matter. This is, in, general, anisotropic, ; that is to say, it has not the same properties, in all directions. On the other hand, media such as glass or water are, isotropic, having equivalent properties in all directions. It was the, study of optics which first showed that the propagation of light in a, crystal is dependent upon the elements of symmetry in that crystal. The, same thing is true for the conduction of heat or electricity, for, magnetization, for polarization, etc., It was in reflecting upon the relations between cause and effect that, govern these phenomena that Pierre Curie was led to complete and extend, the idea of symmetry, by considering it as a condition of space, characteristic of the medium in which a given phenomenon occurs. To, define this condition it is necessary to consider not only the, constitution of the medium but also its condition of movement and the, physical agents to which it is subordinated. Thus a right circular, cylinder possesses a plane of symmetry perpendicular to its axis in its, position, and an infinity of planes of symmetry pass through its axis., If the same cylinder is in rotation on its axis, the first plane of, symmetry persists, but all the others are suppressed. Furthermore, if an,"

Thus a right circular, cylinder possesses a plane of symmetry perpendicular to its axis in its, position, and an infinity of planes of symmetry pass through its axis., If the same cylinder is in rotation on its axis, the first plane of, symmetry persists, but all the others are suppressed. Furthermore, if an, electric current traverses the cylinder lengthwise, no plane of symmetry, remains., In every phenomenon the elements of symmetry compatible with its, existence may be determined. Certain elements can coexist with certain, phenomena, but they are not necessary to them. That which is necessary, is that certain ones among these elements shall not exist. It is, dissymmetry, that creates the phenomenon. When several phenomena are, superposed in the same system, the dissymmetries are added together., ""Works of Pierre Curie, "" page 127., It was from the above considerations that Pierre Curie announced the, general law whose text, already cited, attains the highest degree of, generalization. The synthesis thus obtained seems complete, and all that, was further needed was to deduce from it all the developments of which, it admits., For this it is convenient to define the particular symmetry of each, phenomenon and to introduce a classification which makes clear the, principal groups of symmetry. Mass, electric charge, temperature, have, the same symmetry, of a type called, scalar, that of the sphere.

"For this it is convenient to define the particular symmetry of each, phenomenon and to introduce a classification which makes clear the, principal groups of symmetry. Mass, electric charge, temperature, have, the same symmetry, of a type called, scalar, that of the sphere. A, current of water and a rectilineal electric current have the symmetry of, an arrow, of the type, polar vector, . The symmetry of an upright, circular cylinder is of the type, tensor, . All of the physics of, crystals can be expressed in a form in which the particular phenomena in, question are not specified, but in which are examined only the, geometrical and analytical relations between the types of quantities, where certain ones are considered as causes and the other as effects., Thus, the study of electrical polarization by the application of an, electric field becomes the examination of the relation between two, systems of vectors, and the writing out of a system of linear equations, having 9 coefficients. The same system of equations holds for the, relation between an electric field and an electric current in, crystalline conductors; or for that between the temperature gradient and, the heat current, except that the meaning of the coefficients must be, changed. Similarly, a study of the general relations between a vector, and a system of tensors can reveal all the characteristics of, piezo-electric phenomena. And all the rich variety of the phenomena of, elasticity depends on the relation between two sets of tensors which, require, in principle, 36 coefficients., The foregoing brief"

And all the rich variety of the phenomena of, elasticity depends on the relation between two sets of tensors which, require, in principle, 36 coefficients., The foregoing brief exposition reveals the high philosophic import of, these conceptions of symmetry which touch all natural phenomena, and, whose profound significance Pierre Curie so clearly set forth. It is, interesting in this connection to recall the relation which Pasteur saw, between these same conceptions and the manifestations of life. ""The, universe, "" he said, ""is a dissymmetric whole. I am led to believe that, life, as it is revealed to us, must be a function of the dissymmetry of, the universe, or of the consequences that it involves."", As his organization of his work in the School progressed, Pierre Curie, could begin to dream of going forward again with his experimental, research. He could do so, however, only under most precarious, conditions, for he had not even a laboratory for his personal work, nor, a room of any kind entirely at his disposition. Besides, he possessed no, funds to support his investigations. It was only after he had been, several years at the School that he obtained, thanks to the influence of, Schützenberger, a small annual subvention for his work.

It was only after he had been, several years at the School that he obtained, thanks to the influence of, Schützenberger, a small annual subvention for his work. Up to that time, the materials necessary for him were provided, thanks to the kindness of, his superiors, to the extent possible, by drawing upon a very limited, general fund of the teaching laboratory. As for a place to work in, he, had to content himself with very little. He set up certain of his, experiments in the rooms of his pupils when these were not in use. But, more frequently he worked in an outside corridor running between a, stairway and a laboratory. It was there that he conducted, in, particular, his long research on magnetism., This abnormal state of affairs was manifestly prejudicial to his work, but it had, nevertheless, the happy result of bringing his students, closer to him, for it allowed them, at times, to share in his personal, scientific interests., His return to experimental research is marked by a profound study of the, ""direct reading periodic precision balance for least weights."" (1889, 1890, 1891.) In this balance, the use of small weights is suppressed by, the employment of a microscope by means of which one reads a micrometer, attached to the extremity of one of the arms of the balance.

"marked by a profound study of the, ""direct reading periodic precision balance for least weights."" (1889, 1890, 1891.) In this balance, the use of small weights is suppressed by, the employment of a microscope by means of which one reads a micrometer, attached to the extremity of one of the arms of the balance. The reading, is made when the oscillation of the balance is arrested, which can occur, very rapidly, thanks to the use of pneumatic dampeners conveniently, constructed. This balance marks a considerable advance over old systems., It has shown itself particularly valuable in laboratories for chemical, analysis, where the rapidity of the weighings is frequently a test of, precision. We can say that the introduction of the Curie balances marks, an epoch in the construction of these instruments. The work done in this, field was far from empirical; it comprised a study of the theory of, damped movements and the construction of numerous curves established, with the aid of some of his students., It was toward 1891 that Pierre Curie began a long series of, investigations on the magnetic properties of bodies at divers, temperatures, from the normal up to 1400° C. These investigations, covering years, were presented as a Doctor's thesis before the Faculty, of Sciences of the University of Paris in 1895. In it he stated, precisely in the following few words the object and results of his work:, ""From the point of view of their magnetic properties, bodies may be, divided into two groups:, diamagnetic, bodies, bodies only feebly, magnetic,"

In it he stated, precisely in the following few words the object and results of his work:, ""From the point of view of their magnetic properties, bodies may be, divided into two groups:, diamagnetic, bodies, bodies only feebly, magnetic, and, paramagnetic, bodies., [4], At first sight the two groups, seem entirely separate. The principal aim of this research has been to, discover if there exist transitions between these two states of matter, and if it is possible to make a given body pass progressively through, them. To determine this I have examined the properties of a great number, of bodies at temperatures differing as much as possible, in magnetic, fields of varying intensities., ""My experiments failed to prove any relation between the properties of, diamagnetic, and those of, paramagnetic, bodies., And the, results support the theories which attribute magnetism and diamagnetism, to causes of a different nature, . On the contrary, the properties of, ferro-magnetic, bodies and of bodies, feebly magnetic, are, intimately united."", This experimental work presented many difficulties, for it necessitated, the measuring of very minute forces (of the order of ¹⁄₁₀₀ of a, milligramme weight) within a container where the temperature could, attain 400° C., As Pierre Curie well understood, the results he obtained are, from a, theoretic point of view, of fundamental importance.

"presented many difficulties, for it necessitated, the measuring of very minute forces (of the order of ¹⁄₁₀₀ of a, milligramme weight) within a container where the temperature could, attain 400° C., As Pierre Curie well understood, the results he obtained are, from a, theoretic point of view, of fundamental importance. The Curie law, according to which the coefficient of magnetization of a body feebly, magnetized varies in inverse ratio to the absolute temperature, is a, remarkably simple law. It is quite comparable to the Gay-Lussac law, relating to the variation of the density of a perfect gas with the, temperature. In his well known theory of magnetism P. Langevin, in 1905, took into account the Curie law and arrived again, theoretically, at the, difference between the origins of diamagnetism and paramagnetism. His, work, as well as the important investigations of P. Weiss, demonstrated, the accuracy of Pierre Curie's conclusions, as well as the importance of, the analogy that he perceived between the intensity of magnetization and, the density of a fluid—the paramagnetic state being comparable to a, gaseous state, and the ferro-magnetic state to the state of, condensation., In connection with this work, Pierre Curie spent some time in the search, for unknown phenomena whose existence did not seem, a priori, impossible to him. He sought for bodies strongly diamagnetic, but found, none. He tried to discover, too, if there were bodies that acted as, conductors of magnetism, and if magnetism can exist in a ""free state, "", like electricity. Here also the result was negative."

He never published, any of these investigations, for he had the habit of thus engaging in, the pursuit of phenomena, often with little hope of success, solely for, the love of the unforeseen, and without ever thinking of publication., Because of this entirely disinterested passion for scientific research, the presentation of a doctor's thesis which would give an account of, these early investigations had never appealed to him. He was already, thirty-five years old when he decided to gather together, in such a, thesis, the results of his beautiful work on magnetism., I have a very vivid memory of how he sustained his thesis before the, examiners, for he had invited me, because of the friendship that already, existed between us, to be present on the occasion. The jury was composed, of Professors Bonty, Lippmann, and Hautefeuille. In the audience were, some of his friends, among them his aged father, extremely happy in his, son's success.

"jury was composed, of Professors Bonty, Lippmann, and Hautefeuille. In the audience were, some of his friends, among them his aged father, extremely happy in his, son's success. I remember the simplicity and the clarity of the, exposition, the esteem indicated by the attitude of the professors, and, the conversation between them and the candidate which reminded one of a, meeting of the Physics Society. I was greatly impressed; it seemed to me, that the little room that day sheltered the exaltation of human thought., In recalling this period in the life of Pierre Curie, between 1883 and, 1895, we can appreciate the great progress the young physicist had made, while acting as Chief of Laboratory. He had succeeded during this time, in organizing an entirely new teaching service; he had published an, important series of theoretical memoirs, as well as the results of, experimental research of the first order. In addition, he had, constructed new apparatus of great perfection—and all this in spite, of very insufficient accommodations and resources. This achievement, suggests the distance he had traveled since the doubts and hesitations, of his early youth in learning to discipline his methods of work, and to, derive from them the full advantage of his exceptional capacities., He enjoyed a growing esteem in France, and in foreign countries.

He was, listened to with interest at the meetings of the learned societies, (Society of Physics, Society of Mineralogy, Society of Electricians), where he was in the habit of presenting his communications and where he, joined readily in the discussion of various scientific questions., Among foreign scholars who already at this time appreciated him highly, I can name, in the first place, the illustrious English physicist, Lord, Kelvin, who joined with him in a certain scientific discussion, and who, often expressed for him, from that time on, both esteem and sympathy., During one of his visits to Paris, Lord Kelvin was present at a meeting, of the Society of Physics when Pierre Curie made a statement regarding, the construction and the use of standard condensers with guard ring. In, this statement he recommended the use of an apparatus which involved the, charging of the central part of the guard ring plate by a galvanic cell, and in uniting the guard ring with the earth. One uses then, as a, measure, the charge induced on the second plate. Even though the, resulting disposition of lines of the field be complex, the charge, induced can be calculated by a theorem of electrostatics, with the same, simple formula as is used for an ordinary apparatus in a uniform field, and one has the benefit of a better isolation. Lord Kelvin believed at, first"

Even though the, resulting disposition of lines of the field be complex, the charge, induced can be calculated by a theorem of electrostatics, with the same, simple formula as is used for an ordinary apparatus in a uniform field, and one has the benefit of a better isolation. Lord Kelvin believed at, first that this reasoning was inexact. Despite his great repute and his, advanced age, he went the following day to the laboratory to find the, young Director. Here he discussed the matter with him before the, blackboard. He was completely convinced, and seemed even delighted to, concede the point to his companion., [5], It may seem astonishing that Pierre Curie, in spite of his merits, continued during twelve years in the small position of Chief of, Laboratory. Without doubt this was largely due to the fact that it is, easy to overlook those who have not the active support of influential, persons. It was due also to the fact that it was impossible for him to, take the many steps that the pushing of any candidature involves. Then, too, his independence of character ill fitted him to ask for an advance, and this notwithstanding the fact that his position was very modest., Indeed his salary, then comparable to that of a day laborer (about 300, francs a month), was scarcely sufficient to enable him to lead the, simple life that would yet permit him to carry on his work., He expressed his feelings"
"his independence of character ill fitted him to ask for an advance, and this notwithstanding the fact that his position was very modest., Indeed his salary, then comparable to that of a day laborer (about 300, francs a month), was scarcely sufficient to enable him to lead the, simple life that would yet permit him to carry on his work., He expressed his feelings on this subject in the following words:, ""I have heard that perhaps one of the professors will resign, and that I, might, in that case, make application to succeed him. What an ugly, necessity is this of seeking any position whatsoever; I am not, accustomed to this form of activity, demoralizing to the highest degree., I am sorry that I spoke to you about it. I think that nothing is more, unhealthy to the spirit than to allow oneself to be occupied by things, of this character and to listen to the petty gossip that people come to, report to you."", If he disliked soliciting an advancement in position, he was even less, inclined to hope for honors. He had, in fact, a very decided opinion on, the subject of honorary distinctions. Not only did he believe that they, were not helpful, but he considered them frankly harmful. He felt that, the desire to obtain them is a cause of trouble, and that it can degrade, the worthiest aim of man, which is, work for the pure love of it., Since he possessed great moral probity, he did not hesitate to make"

He felt that, the desire to obtain them is a cause of trouble, and that it can degrade, the worthiest aim of man, which is, work for the pure love of it., Since he possessed great moral probity, he did not hesitate to make his, acts conform to his opinions. When Schützenberger, in order to offer, him a mark of esteem, wished to propose him for the, Palmes, académiques, he refused this distinction, despite the advantages which, according to general belief, it would confer. And he wrote to his, director:, ""I have been informed that you intend to propose me again to the, prefet, for the decoration. I pray you do not do so. If you procure, for me this honor, you will place me under the necessity of refusing it, for I have firmly decided not to accept a decoration of any kind. I hope, that you will be good enough to avoid taking a step that will make me, appear a little ridiculous in the eyes of many people. If your aim is to, offer me a testimony of your interest, you have already done that, and, in a very much more effective manner which touched me greatly, for you, have made it possible for me to work without worry."", Faithful to this firm opinion, he later declined the decoration of the, Légion d'Honneur, which was offered him in 1903., But even though Pierre"
"your aim is to, offer me a testimony of your interest, you have already done that, and, in a very much more effective manner which touched me greatly, for you, have made it possible for me to work without worry."", Faithful to this firm opinion, he later declined the decoration of the, Légion d'Honneur, which was offered him in 1903., But even though Pierre Curie refused to take steps to change his, situation it was at last improved. In 1895 the well-known physicist, Mascart, professor in the Collège de France, impressed with his, ability, and with Lord Kelvin's opinion of him, insisted that, Schützenberger create a new Chair of Physics at the School of Physics, and Chemistry. Pierre Curie was then named professor under conditions in, which his talents were duly recognized. However, nothing was done at, this time to ameliorate the inadequate material conditions under which, as we have already seen, he was carrying on his personal investigations., [3], In this very brief memoir is presented, for the first time, a theory which explains why crystals develop certain faces, simultaneously, in a particular direction, and consequently why crystals, possess a determined form., [4], Paramagnetic, bodies are those which are magnetized in the, same manner as iron, either strongly (, ferro-magnetic, ) or feebly., Diamagnetic, bodies are those whose very feeble magnetization is, opposed to that which iron takes in the same magnetic field., [5], The following is the text of a letter from this, distinguished savant to Pierre Curie, written during one of his visits,"

PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER, I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894. I, was then living in Paris where for three years I, [6], had been studying at, the Sorbonne. I had passed the examinations for the licentiate in, physics, and was preparing for those in mathematics. At the same time I, had begun to work in the research laboratory of Professor Lippmann.

"I had passed the examinations for the licentiate in, physics, and was preparing for those in mathematics. At the same time I, had begun to work in the research laboratory of Professor Lippmann. A, Polish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre, Curie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and, his wife., As I entered the room, Pierre Curie was standing in the recess of a, French window opening on a balcony. He seemed to me very young, though, he was at that time thirty-five years old. I was struck by the open, expression of his face and by the slight suggestion of detachment in his, whole attitude. His speech, rather slow and deliberate, his simplicity, and his smile, at once grave and youthful, inspired confidence. We began, a conversation which soon became friendly. It first concerned certain, scientific matters about which I was very glad to be able to ask his, opinion. Then we discussed certain social and humanitarian subjects, which interested us both. There was, between his conceptions and mine, despite the difference between our native countries, a surprising, kinship, no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral, atmosphere in which we were both raised by our families., We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory.

"no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral, atmosphere in which we were both raised by our families., We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked, if he might call upon me. I lived at that time in a room on the sixth, floor of a house situated near the schools. It was a poor little room, for my resources were extremely limited. I was, nevertheless, very happy, in it for I was now first realizing, although already twenty-five years, old, the ardent desire I had so long cherished of carrying on advanced, studies in science., Pierre Curie came to see me, and showed a simple and sincere sympathy, with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his, dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and, he asked me to share that life. It was not, however, easy for me to make, such a decision, for it meant separation from my country and my family, and the renouncement of certain social projects that were dear to me., Having grown up in an atmosphere of patriotism kept alive by the, oppression of Poland, I wished, like many other young people of my, country, to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national, spirit., So matters stood, when at the beginning of my vacation I left Paris to, go to my father in Poland.

"alive by the, oppression of Poland, I wished, like many other young people of my, country, to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national, spirit., So matters stood, when at the beginning of my vacation I left Paris to, go to my father in Poland. Our correspondence during this separation, helped to strengthen the bond of affection between us., During the year 1894 Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me, admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the, habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of, sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a, companion know him as he was. The very quality of the expression has, always seemed to me remarkable. No other one could describe in a few, lines, as he could, a state of mind, or a situation, and by the simplest, means make that description evoke a seizing image of truth. Because of, this gift, he might, I believe, have been a great writer. I have already, cited a few fragments of his letters, and others will follow. It is, appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the, possibility of our marriage:, ""We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have, the one for the, other, at least a great affection. Provided that you do not change your, mind! For there are no promises which hold; these are things that do not, admit"

It is, appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the, possibility of our marriage:, ""We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have, the one for the, other, at least a great affection. Provided that you do not change your, mind! For there are no promises which hold; these are things that do not, admit of compulsion., ""It would, nevertheless, be a beautiful thing in which I hardly dare, believe, to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your, dream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science., Of all these dreams, I believe the last, alone, is legitimate. I mean to, say by this that we are powerless to change the social order. Even if, this were not true we should not know what to do. And in working without, understanding we should never be sure that we were not doing more harm, than good, by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the point of, view of science, on the contrary, we can pretend to accomplish, something. The territory here is more solid and obvious, and however, small it is, it is truly in our possession., ""I strongly advise you to return to Paris in October. I shall be very, unhappy if you do not come this year, but it is not my friend's, selfishness that makes me ask you to return.

I shall be very, unhappy if you do not come this year, but it is not my friend's, selfishness that makes me ask you to return. I ask it because I believe, you will work better here and that you can accomplish here something, more substantial and more useful."", One can understand, from this letter, that for Pierre Curie there was, only one way of looking at the future. He had dedicated his life to his, dream of science: he felt the need of a companion who could live his, dream with him. He told me many times that the reason he had not married, until he was thirty-six was because he did not believe in the, possibility of a marriage which would meet this, his absolute necessity., When he was twenty-two years old he wrote in his diary:, ""Women, much more than men, love life for life's sake. Women of genius, are rare. And when, pushed by some mystic love, we wish to enter into a, life opposed to nature, when we give all our thoughts to some work which, removes us from those immediately about us, it is with women that we, have to struggle, and the struggle is nearly always an unequal one. For, in the name of life and of nature they seek to lead us back."", We can see, however, in the letters I have quoted earlier, the, unshakeable faith that Pierre Curie had"
"our thoughts to some work which, removes us from those immediately about us, it is with women that we, have to struggle, and the struggle is nearly always an unequal one. For, in the name of life and of nature they seek to lead us back."", We can see, however, in the letters I have quoted earlier, the, unshakeable faith that Pierre Curie had in science and in its power to, further the general good of humanity. It seems appropriate to apply to, him the sentiment expressed by Pasteur in words so well known: ""I, believe invincibly that science and peace will triumph over ignorance, and war."", This confidence in the solutions of science made Pierre Curie little, inclined to take an active part in politics. He was attached, by, education and by conviction, to democratic and socialistic ideas, but he, was not dominated by any party doctrine. However, he always fulfilled, as his father did, his obligations as a voter. In public life, as in, private life, he was opposed to the use of violence., ""What would you think, "" he wrote me, ""of a person who would knock his, head against a stone wall with the intention of overthrowing it? Such an, idea might be the result of very beautiful feelings, but in realization, it would be ridiculous and stupid. I believe that certain questions, demand a general solution, and do not admit, today, of specific, solutions, and that one who begins a course that has no issue, may do, much harm. I believe,"
"against a stone wall with the intention of overthrowing it? Such an, idea might be the result of very beautiful feelings, but in realization, it would be ridiculous and stupid. I believe that certain questions, demand a general solution, and do not admit, today, of specific, solutions, and that one who begins a course that has no issue, may do, much harm. I believe, further, that justice is not of this world, and, that the strongest system or rather the one best developed from the, economic point of view will be that which will stand. A man may exhaust, himself by work, and yet live, at best, miserably. This is a revolting, fact, but it will not, because of that, cease. It will disappear, probably because man is a kind of machine, and it is of economic, advantage to make every machine work in its normal manner, without, forcing it."", He felt the same necessity for clarity and understanding in considering, his own inner life as in examining a general problem. A great necessity, of loyalty to himself and toward others made him suffer from the, compromises imposed by life, even though he reduced them to a minimum., ""We are all the slaves of our affections, "" he wrote, ""slaves of the, prejudices of those we love. Besides, we must make a living, and this, forces us to become a wheel in the machine. The most painful are the, concessions we are forced to make to the prejudices of the society in, which we live.

Besides, we must make a living, and this, forces us to become a wheel in the machine. The most painful are the, concessions we are forced to make to the prejudices of the society in, which we live. We must make more or fewer compromises according as we, feel ourselves feebler or stronger. If one does not make enough, concessions he is crushed; if he makes too many he is ignoble and, despises himself. I find myself far from the principles I held ten years, ago. At that time I believed it necessary to be excessive in everything, and to make no concessions whatsoever to one's environment. I believed, it necessary to exaggerate one's faults as well as one's virtues."", This was the, credo, of the man who, without fortune himself, desired, to share his life with that of a student also without fortune, whom he had, met by chance., After my return from my vacation our friendship grew more and more, precious to us; each realized that he or she could find no better life, companion. We decided, therefore, to marry, and the ceremony took place, in July, 1895.

My husband's parents, received me with great cordiality, and reciprocally my father and my, sisters, who were present at our marriage, were happy in knowing the, family to which I was to belong., Our first home, an extremely simple one, consisted of a little apartment, of three rooms in the rue de la Glacière, not far from the School of, Physics. Its chief attraction was its view of a large garden. It was, furnished very simply with objects that had belonged to our families., Our means did not permit our having servants, so that I had to assume, practically all the household duties, as I had been in the habit of, doing during my student days., Professor Curie's salary was 6000 francs a year, and we held that he, should not undertake any supplementary work, at least in the beginning., As for myself, I was preparing to take the examination for the, agregation, of young women, in view of obtaining a teaching post., These I passed in 1896.

We ordered our life to suit our scientific work, and our days were passed in the laboratory, where Schützenberger, permitted that I might work with my husband., He was then engaged in a research on the growth of crystals, which, interested him keenly. He wished to know if certain faces of a crystal, had a preferential development chiefly because they have a different, rapidity of growth or because their solubility is different. He quickly, obtained interesting results (not published) but he had to interrupt his, investigations to undertake others on radioactivity. And he often, regretted that he was never able to return to them. I was occupied at, this time with the study of the magnetization of tempered steel., The preparation of his class lectures was for Pierre Curie a genuine, care. The Chair was a new one, and carried no prescribed course of, study. He divided his lectures, at first, between crystallography and, electricity. Then, as he recognized more and more the utility of a, serious theoretical course in electricity for future engineers, he, devoted himself entirely to this subject, and succeeded in establishing, a course (of about 120 lectures) that was the most complete and modern, then to be had in Paris. This cost him a considerable effort, of which I, was the daily witness; for he was always anxious to give a complete, picture of the"

I began these researches, by a study of the phosphorescence of uranium, discovered, by M. Becquerel. The results to which I was led by this, work promised to afford so interesting a field that M. Curie, put aside the work on which he was engaged, and joined, me, our object being the extraction of new radio-active, substances and the further study of their properties., Since the commencement of our research we thought it, well to hand over specimens of the substances, discovered, and prepared by ourselves, to certain physicists, in the first, place to M. Becquerel, to whom is due the discovery of the, uranium rays. In this way we ourselves facilitated the, research by others besides ourselves on the new radio-active, bodies.

In this way we ourselves facilitated the, research by others besides ourselves on the new radio-active, bodies. At the termination of our first publications, M., Giesel, in Germany, also began to prepare these substances, and passed on specimens of them to several German, scientists. Finally, these substances were placed on sale in, France and Germany, and the subject growing in importance, gave rise to a scientific movement, such that numerous, memoirs have appeared, and are constantly appearing on, radio-active bodies, principally abroad. The results of the, various French and foreign researches are necessarily confused, as is the case with all new subjects in course of, investigation, the aspect of the question becoming modified, from day to day., From the chemical point of view, however, one point is, definitely established:—, i.e., the existence of a new element, strongly radio-active, viz., radium. The preparation of the, 4, pure chloride of radium and the determination of the atomic, weight of radium form the chief part of my own work., Whilst this work adds to the elements actually known with, certainty a new element with very curious properties, a new, method of chemical research is at the same time established, and justified. This method, based on the consideration of, radio-activity as an atomic property of matter, is just that, which enabled M. Curie and myself to discover the existence, of radium., If,"

This method, based on the consideration of, radio-activity as an atomic property of matter, is just that, which enabled M. Curie and myself to discover the existence, of radium., If, from the chemical point of view, the question that we, undertook primarily may be looked upon as solved, the, study of the physical properties of the radio-active bodies is, in full evolution. Certain important points have been, established, but a large number of the conclusions are still, of a provisional character. This is not surprising when we, consider the complexity of the phenomena due to radio-activity, and the differences existing between the various, radio-active substances. The researches of physicists on, these substances constantly meet and overlap. Whilst, endeavouring to keep strictly to the limits of this work and, to publish my individual research only, I have been obliged, at the same time to mention results of other researches, the, knowledge of which is indispensable., I desired, moreover, to make this work an inclusive, survey of the actual position of the question., I indicate at the end the particular questions with which, I am specially concerned, and those which I investigated in, conjunction with M. Curie., I carried on the work in the laboratories of the School of, Physics and Chemistry in Paris, with the permission of, Schützenberger, late Director of the School,"
"make this work an inclusive, survey of the actual position of the question., I indicate at the end the particular questions with which, I am specially concerned, and those which I investigated in, conjunction with M. Curie., I carried on the work in the laboratories of the School of, Physics and Chemistry in Paris, with the permission of, Schützenberger, late Director of the School, and M. Lauth, actual Director. I take this opportunity of expressing my, gratitude for the kind hospitality received in this school., Historical., The discovery of the phenomena of radio-activity is connected, with researches followed, since the discovery of the, Röntgen rays, upon the photographic effects of phosphorescent, and fluorescent substances., The first tubes for producing Röntgen rays were without, the metallic anticathode. The source of the Röntgen rays, was the glass surface impinged upon by the cathode rays;, this surface was at the same time actively fluorescent. The, question then was whether the emission of Röntgen rays, necessarily accompanied the production of fluorescence, 5, whatever might be the cause of the latter. This idea was, first enunciated by M. Henri Poincaré., Shortly afterwards, M. Henry announced that he had, obtained photographic impressions through black paper by, means of phosphorescent zinc sulphide. M. Niewenglowski, obtained the same phenomenon with calcium sulphide exposed, to the light. Finally, M. Troost obtained strong, photographic impressions with zinc sulphide artificially, phosphorescent acting across black paper and thick cardboard., The experiences just cited have not been reproduced, in, spite of numerous attempts to this end. It cannot therefore,"

Finally, M. Troost obtained strong, photographic impressions with zinc sulphide artificially, phosphorescent acting across black paper and thick cardboard., The experiences just cited have not been reproduced, in, spite of numerous attempts to this end. It cannot therefore, be considered as proved that zinc sulphide and calcium, sulphide are capable of emitting, under the action of light, invisible rays which traverse black paper and act on photographic, plates., M. Becquerel has made similar experiments on the salts, of uranium, some of which are fluorescent., He obtained photographic impressions through black, paper with the double sulphate of uranium and potassium., M. Becquerel at first believed that this salt, which is, fluorescent, behaved like the sulphides of zinc and calcium, in the experiments of MM. Henry, Niewenglowski, and, Troost. But the conclusion of his experiments showed, that the phenomenon observed was in no way related to, the fluorescence. It is not necessary that the salt should, be fluorescent; further, uranium and all its compounds, fluorescent or not, act in the same manner, and metallic, uranium is the most active. M. Becquerel finally found, that by placing uranium compounds in complete darkness, they continue acting on photographic plates through black, paper for years. M. Becquerel allows that uranium and, its compounds emit peculiar rays—uranium rays. He, proved that these rays can penetrate thin metallic screens, and that they discharge electrified bodies. He also"

Becquerel allows that uranium and, its compounds emit peculiar rays—uranium rays. He, proved that these rays can penetrate thin metallic screens, and that they discharge electrified bodies. He also made, experiments from which he concluded that uranium rays, undergo reflection, refraction, and polarisation., The work of other physicists (Elster and Geitel, Lord, Kelvin, Schmidt, Rutherford, Beattie, and Smoluchowski), confirms and extends the results of the researches of M., Becquerel, with the exception of those relating to the reflection, refraction, and polarisation of uranium rays, which, in this respect behave like Röntgen rays, as has been recognised, first by Mr. Rutherford and then by M. Becquerel, himself., 6, CHAPTER I., Radio-activity of Uranium and Thorium. Radio-active Minerals., Becquerel Rays., —The uranium rays discovered by M., Becquerel act upon photographic plates screened from the, light; they can penetrate all solid, liquid, and gaseous substances, provided that the thickness is sufficiently reduced;, in passing through a gas, they cause it to become a feeble, conductor of electricity., These properties of the uranium compounds are not due, to any known cause. The radiation seems to be spontaneous;, it loses nothing in intensity, even on keeping the, compounds in complete darkness for several years; hence, there is no question of the phosphorescence being specially, produced by light., The spontaneity and persistence of the uranium radiation, appear"

The radiation seems to be spontaneous;, it loses nothing in intensity, even on keeping the, compounds in complete darkness for several years; hence, there is no question of the phosphorescence being specially, produced by light., The spontaneity and persistence of the uranium radiation, appear as a quite unique physical phenomenon. M., Becquerel kept a piece of uranium for several years in the, dark, and he has affirmed that at the end of this time the, action upon a photographic plate had not sensibly altered., MM. Elster and Geitel made a similar experiment, and also, found the action to remain constant., I measured the intensity of radiation of uranium by the, effect of this radiation on the conductivity of air. The, method of measurement will be explained later. I also, obtained figures which prove the persistence of radiation, within the limits of accuracy of the experiments., For these measurements a metallic plate was used, covered with a layer of powdered uranium; this plate was, not otherwise kept in the dark; this precaution, according, to the experimenters already quoted, being of no importance., The number of measurements taken with this plate is, very great, and they actually extend over a period of five, years., Some researches were conducted to discover whether, other substances were capable of acting similarly to the, uranium compounds. M. Schmidt was the first to publish, that thorium and its compounds possess exactly the same,"

M. Schmidt was the first to publish, that thorium and its compounds possess exactly the same, property. A similar research, made contemporaneously, gave me the same result. I published this not knowing at, the time of Schmidt’s publication., We shall say that uranium, thorium, and their compounds, emit, Becquerel rays, . I have called, radio-active, those substances which generate emissions of this nature., This name has since been adopted generally., 7, In their photographic and electric effects, the Becquerel, rays approximate to the Röntgen rays. They also, like the, latter, possess the faculty of penetrating all matter. But, their capacity for penetration is very different; the rays of, uranium and of thorium are arrested by some millimetres of, solid matter, and cannot traverse in air a distance greater, than a few centimetres; this at least is the case for the, greater part of the radiation., The researches of different physicists, and primarily of, Mr. Rutherford, have shown that the Becquerel rays, undergo neither regular reflection, nor refraction, nor, polarisation., The feeble penetrating power of uranium and thorium, rays would point to their similarity to the secondary rays, produced by the Röntgen rays, and which have been investigated, by M.

Sagnac, rather than to the Röntgen rays, themselves., For the rest, the Becquerel rays might be classified as, cathode rays propagated in the air. It is now known that, these different analogies are all legitimate., Measurement of the Intensity of Radiation., Fig. 1., The method employed consists in measuring the conductivity, acquired by air under the action of radio-active, bodies; this method possesses the advantage of being rapid, and of furnishing, figures which are, comparable. The apparatus, employed by, me for the purpose, consists essentially of, a plate condenser, A B, (Fig. 1). The, active body, finely, powered, is spread, over the plate, B, making the air between, the plates a, conductor. In order, to measure the conductivity, the plate, B, is raised to a high potential by connecting it with one pole of, a battery of small accumulators, P, of which the other pole is, connected to earth. The plate, A, being maintained at the, potential of the earth by the connection, C D, an electric current, is set up between the two plates. The potential of plate, A, is, 8, recorded by an electrometer, E, . If the earth connection be, broken at, C, the plate, A, becomes charged,"
"small accumulators, P, of which the other pole is, connected to earth. The plate, A, being maintained at the, potential of the earth by the connection, C D, an electric current, is set up between the two plates. The potential of plate, A, is, 8, recorded by an electrometer, E, . If the earth connection be, broken at, C, the plate, A, becomes charged, and this charge, causes a deflection of the electrometer. The velocity of, the deflection is proportional to the intensity of the current, and serves to measure the latter., But a preferable method of measurement is that of compensating, the charge on plate, A, so as to cause no deflection, of the electrometer. The charges in question are, extremely weak; they may be compensated by means of a, quartz electric balance, Q, one sheath of which is connected, to plate, A, and the other to earth. The quartz lamina is, subjected to a known tension, produced by placing weights, in a plate, π; the tension is produced progressively, and, has the effect of generating progressively a known quantity, of electricity during the time observed. The operation can, be so regulated that, at each instant, there is compensation, between the quantity of electricity that traverses the condenser, and that of the opposite kind furnished by the, quartz. In this way, the quantity of electricity passing, through the condenser for a given time, i.e., the, intensity, of the current, can be measured, in absolute units, .

In this way, the quantity of electricity passing, through the condenser for a given time, i.e., the, intensity, of the current, can be measured, in absolute units, . The, measurement is independent of the sensitiveness of the, electrometer., In carrying out a certain number of measurements of this, kind, it is seen that radio-activity is a phenomenon capable, of being measured with a certain accuracy. It varies little, with temperature; it is scarcely affected by variations in, the temperature of the surroundings; it is not influenced, by incandescence of the active substance. The intensity, of the current which traverses the condenser increases with, the surface of the plates. For a given condenser and a, given substance the current increases with the difference, of potential between the plates, with the pressure of the gas, which fills the condenser, and with the distance of the plates, (provided this distance be not too great in comparison with, the diameter). In every case, for great differences of, potential the current attains a limiting value, which is, practically constant. This is the, current of saturation, or, limiting current, . Similarly, for a certain sufficiently great, distance between the plates the current hardly varies any, longer with the distance. It is the current obtained under, these conditions that was taken as the measure of radio-activity, in my researches, the condenser being placed in air, at"

Similarly, for a certain sufficiently great, distance between the plates the current hardly varies any, longer with the distance. It is the current obtained under, these conditions that was taken as the measure of radio-activity, in my researches, the condenser being placed in air, at atmospheric pressure., I append curves which represent the intensity of the, current as a function of the field established between the, 9, plates for two different plate distances. Plate, B, was, covered with a thin layer of powdered metallic uranium;, plate, A, connected with the electrometer, was provided with, a guard-ring., Fig. 2., Fig. 3., Fig. 2 shows that the intensity of the current becomes, constant for high potential differences between the plates., Fig. 3 represents the same curves on another scale, and, comprehends only relative results for small differences of, potential. At the origin, the curve is rectilinear; the, ratio of the intensity of the current to the difference of, 10, potential is constant for weak forces, and represents the, initial conduction between the plates. Two important, characteristic constants of the observed phenomenon are, therefore to be recognised:—(1) The, initial conduction, for, small differences of potential; (2) the, limiting current, for, great potential differences. The limiting current has been, adopted as the measure of the radio-activity., Besides the difference of potential established between, the two plates, there exists between them an electromotive, force of contact, and these two sources of current,"
"characteristic constants of the observed phenomenon are, therefore to be recognised:—(1) The, initial conduction, for, small differences of potential; (2) the, limiting current, for, great potential differences. The limiting current has been, adopted as the measure of the radio-activity., Besides the difference of potential established between, the two plates, there exists between them an electromotive, force of contact, and these two sources of current, combine their effects; for this reason, the absolute value of, the intensity of the current changes with the sign of the, external difference of potential. In every case, for considerable, potential differences, the effect of the electromotive, force of contact is negligible, and the intensity of, the current is therefore the same whatever be the direction, of the field between the plates., The investigation of the conductivity of air and other, gases subjected to the action of Becquerel rays has been, undertaken by several physicists. A very complete research, upon the subject has been published by Mr., Rutherford., The laws of the conductivity produced in gases by the, Becquerel rays are the same as those found for the, Röntgen rays. The mechanics of the phenomenon appear, to be the same in both cases. The theory of ionisation of, the gases by the action of the Röntgen or Becquerel rays, agrees well with the observed facts. This theory will not, be put forward here.

"the same in both cases. The theory of ionisation of, the gases by the action of the Röntgen or Becquerel rays, agrees well with the observed facts. This theory will not, be put forward here. I will merely record the results to, which they point:—, Firstly, the number of ions produced per second in the, gas is considered proportional to the energy of radiation, absorbed by the gas., Secondly, in order to obtain the limiting current relatively, to a given radiation, it is necessary, on the one, hand, to cause complete absorption of this radiation by the, gas by employing a sufficient mass of it; on the other, hand, it is necessary for the production of the current to, use all the ions generated by establishing an electric field of, such strength that the number of the ions which recombine, may be a negligible fraction of the total number of ions, produced in the same time, most of which are carried by, the current to the electrodes. The strength of the electric, field necessary to give this result is proportional to the, amount of ionisation., According to the recent researches of Mr. Townsend, the, 11, phenomenon is more complex when the pressure of the gas, is low. At first the current appears to approach to a, constant limiting value with increasing difference of, potential; but after a certain point has been reached, the, current begins again to increase with the field, and with, very great rapidity.

"Townsend, the, 11, phenomenon is more complex when the pressure of the gas, is low. At first the current appears to approach to a, constant limiting value with increasing difference of, potential; but after a certain point has been reached, the, current begins again to increase with the field, and with, very great rapidity. Mr. Townsend ascribes this increase, to a new ionisation produced by the ions themselves when, under the action of the electric field, they acquire a velocity, such that a molecule of gas encountering one of them becomes, broken down into its constituent ions. A strong, electric field and a low pressure are favourable to the production, of this ionisation by ions already present, and, as, soon as the action is set up, the intensity of the current increases, uniformly with the field between the plates. The, limiting current could, therefore, only be obtained under, conditions of ionisation of which the intensity does not, exceed a certain value, and in such a manner that saturation, corresponds to fields in which, from multiplicity of ions, ionisation can no longer take place. This condition has, occurred in my experiments., The order of magnitude of the saturation currents, obtained with uranium compounds is 10, –11, ampères for a, condenser in which the plates have a diameter of 8 c.m., and are at a distance of 3 c.m.

This phenomenon was observed, for the first time with radium, and will be described later., The radio-activity of thorium and uranium compounds, appears as an, atomic property, . M. Becquerel has already, observed that all uranium compounds are active, and had, concluded that their activity was due to the presence of the, element uranium; he also demonstrated that uranium, was more active than its salts.

The chemical combinations and, mixtures containing uranium or thorium are active in proportion, 14, to the amount of the metal contained, all inactive, material acting as inert bodies and absorbing the radiation., Is Atomic Radio-activity a general Phenomenon?, As I have said above, I made experiments to discover, whether substances other than compounds of uranium and, thorium were radio-active. I undertook this research with, the idea that it was scarcely probable that radio-activity, considered as an atomic property, should belong to a, certain kind of matter to the exclusion of all other. The, determinations I made permit me to say that, for chemical, elements actually considered as such, including the rarest, and most hypothetical, the compounds I investigated were, always at least 100 times less active in my apparatus than, metallic uranium., The following is a summary of the substances experimented, upon, either as the element or in combination:—, 1.

A large number of rocks and minerals., Within the limits of sensitiveness of any apparatus, I, found no simple substance, other than uranium and, thorium, possessing atomic radio-activity. It will be, suitable to add a few words here concerning phosphorus., White moist phosphorus, placed between the plates of the, condenser, causes the air between the plates to conduct., However, I do not consider this body radio-active in the, same manner as thorium and uranium. For, under these, conditions, phosphorus becomes oxidised and emits, luminous rays, whilst uranium and thorium compounds are, radio-active without showing any chemical change which can, be detected by any known means. Further, phosphorus is, not active in the red variety, nor in a state of combination., In a recent work, M.

Bloch has demonstrated that phosphorus, undergoing oxidation in air, gives rise to slightly, motile ions, which make the air conduct, and cause condensation, of aqueous vapour., Uranium and thorium are elements which possess the, highest atomic weights (240 and 232); they occur frequently, in the same minerals., 15, Radio-active Minerals., I have examined many minerals in my apparatus; certain, of them gave evidence of radio-activity, e.g., pitchblende, thorite, orangite, fergusonite, cleveite, chalcolite, autunite, monazite, &c. The following is a table giving in ampères, the intensity, i, of the current obtained with metallic, uranium and with different minerals:—, i, × 10, 11, ., Uranium, 2·3, Pitchblende from Johanngeorgenstadt, 8·3, Pitchblende from Joachimsthal, 7·0, Pitchblende from Pzibran, 6·5, Pitchblende from Cornwallis, 1·6, Cleveite, 1·4, Chalcolite, 5·2, Autunite, 2·7, Various thorites, 0·1, 0·3, 0·7, 1·3, 1·4, Orangite, 2·0, Monazite, 0·5, Xenotime, 0·03, Æschynite, 0·7, Fergusonite (two samples), 0·4, 0·1, Samarskite, 1·1, Niobite (two samples), 0·1, 0·3, Tantalite, 0·02, Carnotite, 6·2, The current obtained with orangite (native oxide of, thorium) varied greatly with the thickness of the layer.

By, increasing this thickness from 0·25 m.m. to 6 m.m. the, current increased from 1·8 to 2·3., All the minerals which showed radio-activity contained, uranium or thorium: their activity is therefore not surprising, but the intensity of the action in certain cases is, unexpected. Thus pitchblendes (ores of uranium oxide) are, found which are four times as active as metallic uranium., Chalcolite (double phosphate of copper and uranium) is, twice as active as uranium. Autunite (phosphate of, uranium and calcium) is as active as uranium. These, facts do not accord with previous conclusions, according, 16, to which no mineral should be so active as thorium or, uranium., To throw light on this point, I prepared artificial, chalcolite by the process of Debray, starting with the pure, products. The process consists in mixing a solution of, uranium nitrate with a solution of copper phosphate in, phosphoric acid and warming to 50° or 60°. After some, time, crystals of chalcolite appear in the liquid., Chalcolite thus obtained possesses a perfectly normal, activity, given by its composition; it is two and a-half times, less active than uranium., It therefore appeared probable that if pitchblende, chalcolite, and autunite possess so great a degree of, activity, these substances contain a small quantity of a, strongly radio-active body, differing from uranium and, thorium and the simple bodies actually known.

I thought, that if this were indeed the case, I might hope to extract, this substance from the ore by the ordinary methods of, chemical analysis., CHAPTER II., Method of Research., The results of the investigation of radio-active minerals, announced in the preceding chapter, led M. Curie and myself, to endeavour to extract a new radio-active body from pitchblende., Our method of procedure could only be based on, radio-activity, as we know of no other property of the hypothetical, substance. The following is the method pursued, for a research based on radio-activity:—The radio-activity, of a compound is determined, and a chemical decomposition, of this compound is effected; the radio-activity of all the, products obtained is determined, having regard to the proportion, in which the radio-active substance is distributed, among them. In this way, an indication is obtained, which, may to a certain extent be compared to that which spectrum, analysis furnishes. In order to obtain comparable figures, the activity of the substances must be determined in the, solid form well dried., Polonium, Radium, Actinium., The analysis of pitchblende with the help of the method, just explained, led us to the discovery in this mineral of two, strongly radio-active substances, chemically dissimilar:—Polonium, discovered by ourselves, and radium, which we, discovered"

In order to obtain comparable figures, the activity of the substances must be determined in the, solid form well dried., Polonium, Radium, Actinium., The analysis of pitchblende with the help of the method, just explained, led us to the discovery in this mineral of two, strongly radio-active substances, chemically dissimilar:—Polonium, discovered by ourselves, and radium, which we, discovered in conjunction with M. Bémont., 17, Polonium, from the analytical point of view, is analogous, to bismuth, and separates out with the latter. By one of, the following methods of fractionating, bismuth products, are obtained increasingly rich in polonium:—, 1. Sublimation of the sulphides, in vacuo, ; the active sulphide, is much more volatile than bismuth sulphide., 2. Precipitation of solutions of the nitrate by water; the, precipitate of the basic nitrate is much more active than the, salt which remains in solution., 3. Precipitation by sulphuretted hydrogen of a hydrochloric, acid solution, strongly acid; the precipitated sulphides, are considerably more active than the salt which, remains in solution., Radium, is a substance which accompanies the barium, obtained from pitchblende; it resembles barium in its reactions, and is separated from it by difference of solubility, of the chlorides in water, in dilute alcohol, or in water, acidified with hydrochloric acid. We effect the separation, of the chlorides of barium and radium by subjecting the mixture, to fractional crystallisation, radium chloride being less, soluble than that of barium., A third strongly radio-active body has been identified in, pitchblende by M.

We effect the separation, of the chlorides of barium and radium by subjecting the mixture, to fractional crystallisation, radium chloride being less, soluble than that of barium., A third strongly radio-active body has been identified in, pitchblende by M. Debierne, who gave it the name of, actinium, . Actinium accompanies certain members of the, iron group contained in pitchblende; it appears in particular, allied to thorium, from which it has not yet been found, possible to separate it. The extraction of actinium from, pitchblende is a very difficult operation, the separations, being as a rule incomplete., All three of the new radio-active bodies occur in quite, infinitesimal amount in pitchblende. In order to obtain, them in a more concentrated condition, we were obliged to, treat several tons of residue of the ore of uranium. The, rough treatment was carried out in the factory; and this, was followed by processes of purification and concentration., We thus succeeded in extracting from thousands of kilogrms., of crude material a few decigrammes of products which, were exceedingly active as compared with the ore from which, they were obtained. It is obvious that this process is long, arduous, and costly., Other new radio-active bodies have been notified since the, termination of our work. M. Giesel, on the one hand, and, MM. Hoffmann and Strauss on the other, have announced, the probable existence of a radio-active body similar to lead,"

Hoffmann and Strauss on the other, have announced, the probable existence of a radio-active body similar to lead, in its chemical properties. At present only a few samples, of this substance have been obtained., 18, Radium is, so far, the only member of the new radio-active, substances that has been isolated as the pure salt., Spectrum of Radium., It was of the first importance to check, by all possible, means, the hypothesis, underlying this work, of new radio-active, elements. In the case of radium, spectrum analysis, was the means of confirming this hypothesis., M. Demarçay undertook the examination of the new radio-active, bodies by the searching methods which he employs in, the study of photographic spark spectra., The assistance of so competent a scientist was of the, greatest value to us, and we are deeply grateful to him for, having consented to take up this work. The results of the, spectrum analysis brought conviction to us when we were, still in doubt as to the interpretation of the results of our, research., The first specimens of fairly active barium chloride containing, radium, examined by M.

"The results of the, spectrum analysis brought conviction to us when we were, still in doubt as to the interpretation of the results of our, research., The first specimens of fairly active barium chloride containing, radium, examined by M. Demarçay, exhibited, together with the barium lines a new line of considerable intensity, and of wave-length λ = 381·47 µµ in the ultra-violet., With the more active products prepared subsequently, Demarçay, saw the line 381·47 µµ more distinctly; at the same, time other new lines appeared, and the intensity of the new, lines was comparable with that of the barium lines. A further, concentration furnished a product for which the new spectrum, predominated, and the three strongest barium lines, alone visible, merely indicated the presence of this metal as, an impurity. This product may be looked upon as nearly, pure radium chloride. Finally, by further purification, I, obtained an exceedingly pure chloride, in the spectrum of, which the two chief barium lines were scarcely visible., The following is a list, according to Demarçay, of the, principal radium lines for the portion of the spectrum included, between λ = 500·0 and λ = 350·0 µµ. The intensity, of each line is represented by a figure, the strongest being, marked 16:—, λ., Intensity., 482·63, 10, 472·69, 5, 469·98, 3, 469·21, 7, 468·30, 14, 464·19, 4, 460·03, 3, 453·35, 9, 443·61, 8, 434·06, 12, 381·47, 16, 364·96, 12, All the lines are clear and narrow, the three lines 381·47, 19, 468·30, 434·06 are strong, and equal the most intense of,"

Two well-marked misty bands are, also visible in the spectrum. The first, which is symmetrical, extends from 463·10 to 462·19, with a maximum, at 462·75. The second, which is stronger, fades towards, the ultra-violet; it begins, sharply defined, at 446·37, and, passes through a maximum at 445·52; the region of the, maximum extends as far as 445·34, then a nebulous band, gradually fading, extends about as far as 439., In the least refrangible part, not photographed in the, spark spectrum, the only significant line is 566·5 (approx.), much more feeble, however, than 482·63., The general aspect of the spectrum is that of the metals, of the alkaline earths; these metals are known to have, well-marked line spectra with certain nebulous bands., According to Demarçay, the position of radium may, be among the bodies possessing the most sensitive spectrum, reaction. I also have concluded from the work of concentration, that in the first specimen examined, which showed, clearly the line 3814·7, the proportion of radium must have, been very small (perhaps about 0·02 per cent).

Nevertheless, an activity fifty times as great as that of metallic uranium, is required in order to distinguish clearly the principal, radium line in the spectra photographed. With a sensitive, electrometer the radio-activity of a substance only 1/100, of that of metallic uranium can be detected. It is clear, that, in order to detect the presence of radium, the property, of radio-activity is several thousand times more sensitive, than the spectrum reaction., Bismuth containing polonium and thorium containing, actinium, both very active, examined by Demarçay, have so, far each only yielded bismuth and thorium lines., In a recent publication, M. Giesel, who is occupied in, preparing radium, states that radium bromide gives a, carmine flame colouration. The flame spectrum of radium, contains two beautiful red bands, one line in the blue-green, and two faint lines in the violet., Extraction of the New Radio-active Substances., The first stage of the operation consists in extracting, barium with radium from the ores of uranium, also bismuth, with polonium and the rare earths containing actinium, from the same.

These three primary products having been, obtained, the next step is in each case to endeavour to, isolate the new radio-active body. This second part of the, treatment consists of a process of fractionation. The, 20, difficulty of finding a very perfect means of separating, closely allied elements is well known; methods of fractionation, are therefore quite suitable. Besides this, when a, mere trace of one element is mixed with another element, no method of complete separation could be applied to the, mixture, even allowing that such a method was known; in, fact, one would run the risk of losing the trace of the, material to be separated., The particular object of my work has been the isolation, of radium and polonium. After working for several years, I have so far only succeeded in obtaining the former., Pitchblende is an expensive ore, and we have given up, the treatment of it in large quantities. In Europe the, extraction of this ore is carried out in the mine of, Joachimsthal, in Bohemia. The crushed ore is roasted with, carbonate of soda, and the resulting material washed, first, with warm water and then with dilute sulphuric acid.

This residue, contains radio-active substances; its activity is four and a-half, times that of metallic uranium. The Austrian Government, to whom the mine belongs, presented us with a ton, of this residue for our research, and authorised the mine to, give us several tons more of the material., It was not very easy to apply the methods of the, laboratory to the preliminary treatment of the residue in, the factory. M. Debierne investigated this question, and, organised the treatment in the factory. The most important, point of his method is the conversion of the sulphates, into carbonate by boiling the material with a, concentrated solution of sodium carbonate. This method, avoids the necessity of fusing with sodium carbonate., The residue chiefly contains the sulphates of lead and, calcium, silica, alumina, and iron oxide. In addition, nearly all the metals are found in greater or smaller, amount (copper, bismuth, zinc, cobalt, manganese, nickel, vanadium, antimony, thallium, rare earths, niobium, tantalum, arsenic, barium, &c.). Radium is found in this, mixture as sulphate, and is the least soluble sulphate in it., In order to dissolve it, it is necessary to remove the, sulphuric acid as far as possible.

To do this, the residue is, first treated with a boiling concentrated soda solution., The sulphuric acid combined with the lead, aluminium, and calcium passes, for the most part, into solution as sulphate, of sodium, which is removed by repeatedly washing, with water. The alkaline solution removes at the same, 21, time lead, silicon, and aluminium. The insoluble portion, is attacked by ordinary hydrochloric acid. This operation, completely disintegrates the material, and dissolves most, of it. Polonium and actinium may be obtained from this, solution; the former is precipitated by sulphuretted, hydrogen, the latter is found in the hydrates precipitated by, ammonia in the solution separated from the sulphides and, oxidised. Radium remains in the insoluble portion. This, portion is washed with water, and then treated with a, boiling concentrated solution of carbonate of soda. This, operation completes the transformation of the sulphates of, barium and radium into carbonates. The material is then, thoroughly washed with water, and then treated with dilute, hydrochloric acid, quite free from sulphuric acid.

The solution still contains a little actinium and, polonium, which may be separated out as in the case of the, first hydrochloric acid solution., From one ton of residue 10 to 20 kilogrms. of crude sulphates, are obtained, the activity of which is from thirty to, sixty times as great as that of metallic uranium. They, must now be purified. For this purpose they are boiled, with sodium carbonate and transformed into the chlorides., The solution is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, which, gives a small quantity of active sulphides containing, polonium. The solution is filtered, oxidised by means of, chlorine, and precipitated with pure ammonia. The precipitated, hydrates and oxides are very active, and the, activity is due to actinium. The filtered solution is precipitated, with sodium carbonate. The precipitated carbonates, of the alkaline earths are washed and converted, into chlorides. These chlorides are evaporated to dryness, and washed with pure concentrated hydrochloric acid., Calcium chloride dissolves almost entirely, whilst the, chloride of barium and radium remains insoluble.

"The filtered solution is precipitated, with sodium carbonate. The precipitated carbonates, of the alkaline earths are washed and converted, into chlorides. These chlorides are evaporated to dryness, and washed with pure concentrated hydrochloric acid., Calcium chloride dissolves almost entirely, whilst the, chloride of barium and radium remains insoluble. Thus, from one ton of the original material about 8 kilogrms. of, barium and radium chloride are obtained, of which the, activity is about sixty times that of metallic uranium. The, chloride is now ready for fractionation., Polonium., As I said above, by passing sulphuretted hydrogen, through the various hydrochloric acid solutions obtained, 22, during the course of the process, active sulphides are precipitated, of which the activity is due to polonium. These, sulphides chiefly contain bismuth, a little copper and lead;, the latter metal occurs in relatively small amount, because, it has been to a great extent removed by the soda solution, and because its chloride is only slightly soluble. Antimony, and arsenic are found among the oxides only in the, minutest quantity, their oxides having been dissolved by, the soda. In order to obtain the very active sulphides, the, following process was employed:—The solutions made, strongly acid with hydrochloric acid were precipitated with, sulphuretted hydrogen; the sulphides thus precipitated are, very active, and are employed for the preparation of, polonium; there remain in the solution substances not, completely precipitated in presence of excess of hydrochloric, acid (bismuth, lead, antimony). To complete the, precipitation, the solution is diluted with water, and, treated again with sulphuretted hydrogen, which"

To complete the, precipitation, the solution is diluted with water, and, treated again with sulphuretted hydrogen, which gives a, second precipitate of sulphides, much less active than the, first, and which have generally been rejected. For the, further purification of the sulphides, they are washed with, ammonium sulphide, which removes the last remaining, traces of antimony and arsenic. They are then washed, with water and ammonium nitrate, and treated with dilute, nitric acid. Complete solution never occurs; there is, always an insoluble residue, more or less considerable, which can be treated afresh if it is judged expedient. The, solution is reduced to a small volume and precipitated, either by ammonia or by excess of water. In both cases, the lead and the copper remain in solution; in the second, case, a little bismuth, scarcely active at all, remains also in, solution., The precipitate of oxides or basic nitrates is subjected to, fractionation in the following manner:—The precipitate is, dissolved in nitric acid, and water is added to the solution, until a sufficient quantity of precipitate is formed; it must, be borne in mind that sometimes the precipitate does not, at once appear. The precipitate is separated from the, supernatant liquid, and re-dissolved in nitric acid, after, which both the"
"or basic nitrates is subjected to, fractionation in the following manner:—The precipitate is, dissolved in nitric acid, and water is added to the solution, until a sufficient quantity of precipitate is formed; it must, be borne in mind that sometimes the precipitate does not, at once appear. The precipitate is separated from the, supernatant liquid, and re-dissolved in nitric acid, after, which both the liquids thus obtained are re-precipitated, with water, and treated as before. The different fractions, are combined according to their activity, and concentration, is carried out as far as possible. In this way is obtained a, very small quantity of a substance of which the activity is, very high, but which, nevertheless, has so far only shown, bismuth lines in the spectroscope., 23, There is, unfortunately, little chance of obtaining the, isolation of polonium by this means. The method of, fractionation just described presents many difficulties, and, the case is similar with other wet processes of fractionation., Whatever be the method employed, compounds are, readily formed which are absolutely insoluble in dilute or, concentrated acids. These compounds can only be re-dissolved, by reducing them to the metallic state, e.g., by, fusion with potassium cyanide. Considering the number, of operations necessary, this circumstance constitutes an, enormous difficulty in the progress of the fractionation., This obstacle is the greater because polonium, once extracted, from the pitchblende, diminishes in activity.

"by, fusion with potassium cyanide. Considering the number, of operations necessary, this circumstance constitutes an, enormous difficulty in the progress of the fractionation., This obstacle is the greater because polonium, once extracted, from the pitchblende, diminishes in activity. This, diminution of activity is slow, for a specimen of bismuth, nitrate containing polonium only lost half its activity in, eleven months., No such difficulty occurs with radium. The radio-activity, remains throughout an accurate gauge of the concentration;, the concentration itself presents no difficulty, and the progress of the work from the start can be constantly, checked by spectral analysis., When the phenomena of induced radio-activity, which, will be discussed later on, were made known, it seemed, obvious that polonium, which only shows the bismuth, lines and whose activity diminishes with time, was not a, new element, but bismuth made active by the vicinity of, radium in the pitchblende. I am not sure that this opinion, is correct. In the course of my prolonged work on, polonium, I have noted chemical effects, which I have, never observed either with ordinary bismuth or with, bismuth made active by radium. These chemical effects, are, in the first place, the extremely ready formation of, insoluble compounds, of which I have spoken above, (especially basic nitrates), and, in the second place, the, colour and appearance of the precipitates obtained by, adding water to the nitric acid solution of bismuth containing, polonium. These precipitates are sometimes white, but more generally of a more or less vivid yellow, verging, on red., The absence of"

These precipitates are sometimes white, but more generally of a more or less vivid yellow, verging, on red., The absence of lines other than those of bismuth does, not necessarily prove that the substance only contains, bismuth, because bodies exist whose spectrum reaction is, scarcely visible., It would be necessary to prepare a small quantity of, bismuth containing polonium in as concentrated a condition, as possible, and to examine it chemically, in the, 24, first place determining the atomic weight of the metal. It, has not yet been possible to carry out this research on, account of the difficulties of a chemical nature already, mentioned., If polonium were proved to be a new element, it would be, no less true that it cannot exist indefinitely in a strongly, radio-active condition, at least when extracted from the, ore. There are therefore two aspects of the question:—First, whether the activity of polonium is entirely induced, by the proximity of substances themselves radio-active, in, which case polonium would possess the faculty of acquiring, atomic activity permanently, a faculty which does not, appear to belong to any substance whatever; second, whether the activity of polonium is an inherent property, which is spontaneously destroyed under certain conditions, and persists under certain other conditions, such as those, which exist"
"polonium is entirely induced, by the proximity of substances themselves radio-active, in, which case polonium would possess the faculty of acquiring, atomic activity permanently, a faculty which does not, appear to belong to any substance whatever; second, whether the activity of polonium is an inherent property, which is spontaneously destroyed under certain conditions, and persists under certain other conditions, such as those, which exist in the ore. The phenomenon of atomic activity, induced by contact is still so little understood, that we lack, the ground on which to formulate any opinion on the, matter., (, Note., —A work has recently appeared on polonium by, M. Marckwald. He plunges a small rod of pure bismuth, into a hydrochloric acid solution of the bismuth extracted, from the pitchblende residue. After some time the rod, becomes coated with a very active deposit, and the solution, now contains only inactive bismuth. M. Marckwald also, obtains a very active deposit by adding tin chloride to a, hydrochloric acid solution of radio-active bismuth. From, this he concludes that the active element is allied to, tellurium, and gives it the name of, radiotellurium, . This, active substance of M. Marckwald seems identical with, polonium, from its behaviour, and from the easily absorbed, rays it emits. The choice of a new name for this substance, is futile in the present state of the question)., Preparation of the Pure Chloride of Radium., The method by which I extracted pure radium chloride, from barium chloride containing radium consists in first, subjecting the mixture of the chlorides"
"Marckwald seems identical with, polonium, from its behaviour, and from the easily absorbed, rays it emits. The choice of a new name for this substance, is futile in the present state of the question)., Preparation of the Pure Chloride of Radium., The method by which I extracted pure radium chloride, from barium chloride containing radium consists in first, subjecting the mixture of the chlorides to fractional crystallisation, in pure water, then in water to which hydrochloric, acid has been added. The difference in solubility of the, two chlorides is thus made use of, that of radium being less, soluble than that of barium., At the beginning of the fractionation, pure distilled water, is used. The chloride is dissolved, and the solution raised, to boiling-point, and allowed to crystallise by cooling in a, 25, covered capsule. Beautiful crystals form at the bottom, and the supernatant, saturated solution is easily decanted., If part of this solution be evaporated to dryness, the, chloride obtained is found to be about five times less active, than that which has crystallised out. The chloride is thus, divided into two portions, A and B—portion A being more, active than portion B. The operation is now repeated with, each of the chlorides A and B, and in each case two new, portions are obtained. When the crystallisation is finished, the less active fraction of chloride A is added to the more, active fraction of chloride B, these two having approximately, the same activity. Thus there are now three, portions to undergo afresh the same"
"portion B. The operation is now repeated with, each of the chlorides A and B, and in each case two new, portions are obtained. When the crystallisation is finished, the less active fraction of chloride A is added to the more, active fraction of chloride B, these two having approximately, the same activity. Thus there are now three, portions to undergo afresh the same treatment., The number of portions is not allowed to increase indefinitely., The activity of the most soluble portion, diminishes as the number increases. When its activity, becomes inconsiderable, it is withdrawn from the fractionation., When the desired number of fractions has been, obtained, fractionation of the least soluble portion is stopped, (the richest in radium), and it is withdrawn from the, remainder., A fixed number of fractions is used in the process. After, each series of operations, the saturated solution arising, from one fraction is added to the crystals arising from the, following fraction; but if after one of the series the most, soluble fraction has been withdrawn, then, after the following, series, a new fraction is made from the most soluble, portion, and the crystals of the most active portion are, withdrawn. By the successive alteration of these two, processes, an extremely regular system of fractionation is, obtained, in which the number of fractions and the activity, of each remains constant, each being about five times as, active as the subsequent one, and in which, on the one, hand, an almost inactive product is removed, whilst, on the, other, is obtained"

By the successive alteration of these two, processes, an extremely regular system of fractionation is, obtained, in which the number of fractions and the activity, of each remains constant, each being about five times as, active as the subsequent one, and in which, on the one, hand, an almost inactive product is removed, whilst, on the, other, is obtained a chloride rich in radium. The amount, of material contained in these fractions gradually diminishes, becoming less as the activity increases., At first six fractions were used, and the activity of the, chloride obtained at the end was only 0·1 that of uranium., When most of the inactive matter has been removed, and, the fractions have become small, one fraction is removed, from the one end, and another is added to the other end, consisting of the active chloride previously removed. A, chloride richer in radium than the preceding is thus, obtained. This system is continued until the crystals obtained, are pure radium chloride. If the fractionation has, 26, been thoroughly carried out, scarcely any trace of the intermediate, products remain., At an advanced stage of the fractionation, when the, quantity of material in each fraction is small, the separation, by crystallisation is less efficacious, the cooling being too, rapid and the volume of the solution to be decanted too, small. It is then advisable to add water containing a, known quantity of hydrochloric acid; this quantity may be, increased as the fractionation proceeds., The advantage gained thus consists in increasing the,"
"when the, quantity of material in each fraction is small, the separation, by crystallisation is less efficacious, the cooling being too, rapid and the volume of the solution to be decanted too, small. It is then advisable to add water containing a, known quantity of hydrochloric acid; this quantity may be, increased as the fractionation proceeds., The advantage gained thus consists in increasing the, quantity of the solution, the solubility of the chlorides being, less in water acidified with hydrochloric acid than in pure, water. By using water containing much acid, excellent, separations are effected, and it is only necessary to work, with three or four fractions., The crystals, which form in very acid solution, are, elongated needles, those of barium chloride having exactly, the same appearance as those of radium chloride. Both, show double refraction. Crystals of barium chloride containing, radium are colourless, but when the proportion of, radium becomes greater, they have a yellow colouration, after some hours, verging on orange, and sometimes a, beautiful pink. This colour disappears in solution. Crystals, of pure radium chloride are not coloured, so that the, colouration appears to be due to the mixture of radium and, barium. The maximum colouration is obtained for a, certain degree of radium present, and this fact serves to, check the progress of the fractionation., I have sometimes noticed the formation of a deposit, composed of crystals of which one part remained uncoloured, whilst the other was coloured, and it seems, possible that the colourless crystals might be sorted out., The fractional"

This, method, which I first employed, was finally abandoned, for the one just described, which proceeds with more, regularity. I have, however, occasionally made use of, precipitation by alcohol to purify radium chloride which, contains traces of barium chloride. The latter remains in, the slightly aqueous alcoholic solution, and can thus be, removed., M. Giesel, who, since the publication of our first researches, has been preparing radio-active bodies, recommends, the separation of barium and radium by fractional, crystallisation in water from a mixture of the bromides. I, 27, can testify that this method is advantageous, especially in, the first stages of the fractionation., Determination of the Atomic Weight of Radium., In the course of my work I determined at intervals the, atomic weight of the metal contained in specimens of, barium chloride containing radium. With each newly, obtained product I carried the concentration as far as, possible, so as to have from 0·1 grm. to 0·5 grm. of, material containing most of the activity of the mixture., From"
"of the Atomic Weight of Radium., In the course of my work I determined at intervals the, atomic weight of the metal contained in specimens of, barium chloride containing radium. With each newly, obtained product I carried the concentration as far as, possible, so as to have from 0·1 grm. to 0·5 grm. of, material containing most of the activity of the mixture., From this small quantity I precipitated with alcohol or, with hydrochloric acid some milligrams of chloride for, spectral analysis. Thanks to his excellent method, Demarçay only required this small quantity of material to, obtain the photograph of the spark spectrum. I made an, atomic weight determination with the product remaining., I employed the classic method of weighing as silver, chloride the chlorine contained in a known weight of the, anhydrous chloride. As control experiment, I determined, the atomic weight of barium by the same method, under, the same conditions, and with the same quantity of material, first 0·5 grm. and then 0·1 grm. The figures obtained were, always between 137 and 138. I thus saw that the method, gives satisfactory results, even with a very small quantity of, material., The first two determinations were made with chlorides, of which one was 230 times and the other 600 times as, active as uranium. These two experiments gave the same, figure as the experiment with the pure barium chloride., There was therefore no hope of finding a difference except, by using a much more active product.

The following, experiment was made with a chloride, the activity of which, was about 3500 times as great as that of uranium; and, this experiment enabled me, for the first time, to observe a, small but distinct difference; I found, as the mean atomic, weight of the metal contained in this chloride, the number, 140, which showed that the atomic weight of radium must, be higher than that of barium. By using more and more, active products, and obtaining spectra of radium of increasing, intensity, I found that the figures obtained rose in, proportion, as is seen in the following table (p., 28, )., The figures of column A must only be looked upon as a, rough estimate. The calculation of the activity of strongly, radio-active bodies is difficult, for many reasons which will, be discussed later., 28, A., M., 3500, 140, Spectrum of radium faint., 4700, 141, 7500, 145·8, Spectrum of radium strong, but that of barium predominating., Order of Magnitude, 10, 6, ..., 173·8, The two spectra of almost equal intensity., 225, Only a trace of barium present., A represents the activity of the chloride, that of uranium, being unity; M the atomic weight found., At the termination of"

This, radium chloride, in the opinion of Demarçay, was fairly, pure; its spectrum, however, showed the three principal, barium lines with considerable intensity. I made four, successive estimations of the chloride, the results of which, as follows:—, Anhydrous radium chloride., Silver chloride., M., I., 0·1150, 0·1130, 220·7, II., 0·1140, 0·1119, 223·0, III., 0·11135, 0·1086, 222·8, IV., 0·10925, 0·10645, 223·1, I then re-purified this chloride, and obtained a much, purer substance, in the spectrum of which the two strongest, barium lines were very faint. Given the sensitiveness of, the spectrum reaction of barium, Demarçay estimated that, the purified chloride contained only the merest traces of, barium, incapable of influencing the atomic weight to an, appreciable extent. I made three determinations with this, perfectly pure radium chloride. The results were as, follows:—, Anhydrous radium chloride., Silver chloride., M., I., 0·09192, 0·08890, 225·3, II., 0·08936, 0·08627, 225·8, III., 0·08839, 0·08589, 224·0, The mean of these numbers is 225. They were calculated, in the same way as the preceding ones by considering, radium as a"
"influencing the atomic weight to an, appreciable extent. I made three determinations with this, perfectly pure radium chloride. The results were as, follows:—, Anhydrous radium chloride., Silver chloride., M., I., 0·09192, 0·08890, 225·3, II., 0·08936, 0·08627, 225·8, III., 0·08839, 0·08589, 224·0, The mean of these numbers is 225. They were calculated, in the same way as the preceding ones by considering, radium as a bivalent element, the chloride having, the formula RaCl, 2, and taking for silver and chlorine the, values Ag = 107·8, Cl = 35·4., Hence the atomic weight of radium is Ra = 225., The weighings were made with a Curie aperiodic, balance, perfectly regulated, accurate to the twentieth of a, 29, milligrm. This direct reading balance permits of very, rapid weighing, a condition which is essential in the case, of the anhydrous chlorides of radium and barium, which, gradually absorb moisture, in spite of the presence of desiccating, substances in the balance. The bodies to be, weighed were placed in a platinum crucible; this crucible, had been long in use, and its weight did not vary the tenth, part of a milligrm. during the course of one operation., The hydrated chloride obtained by crystallisation was, placed in the crucible and heated till converted into the, anhydrous chloride. When the chloride has been kept for, several hours at 100° its weight becomes constant, and does, not change even if the temperature is raised to 200°.

The, anhydrous chloride thus obtained constitutes, therefore, a, perfectly definite body., The following is a series of determinations on this point., The chloride (100 m.g.) is dried in the oven at 55°, and, placed in a desiccator over anhydrous phosphoric acid; it, then gradually loses weight, which proves that it still, contains moisture; in the course of twelve hours the loss, was 3 m.g. The chloride is replaced in the stove, and the, temperature raised to 100°. During this process, the, chloride lost 6·3 m.g. in weight. After being left three, hours fifteen minutes in the oven, it lost 2·5 m.g. more., The temperature was maintained for forty-five minutes between, 100° and 120°, which caused a loss of weight of 0·1, m.g. Then after being kept for thirty minutes at 125°, the, chloride showed no diminution in weight. Then, however, after thirty minutes at 150°, it lost 0·1 m.g. Finally, after, being heated for four hours at 200°, it lost 0·15 m.g., During these operations the crucible varied from 0·05 m.g., After each determination of the atomic weight, the, radium was converted into the chloride in the following, manner:—To the solution containing the weighed radium, nitrate and excess of silver nitrate was added pure hydrochloric, acid; the silver chloride was"

In this way the nitric acid is, entirely removed., The precipitated silver chloride was always radio-active, and phosphorescent. In determining the amount of silver, contained in it, I satisfied myself that no ponderable, amount of radium had been carried down with it out of the, solution. The method I pursued was to reduce the silver, chloride precipitated in the crucible by hydrogen generated, from dilute hydrochloric acid and zinc; after washing, the, 30, crucible was weighed with the metallic silver contained, in it., I made another experiment which showed that the, weight of radium chloride regenerated was the same as that, before beginning the operation., These verifications are not so reliable as direct experiments;, but they serve to indicate the absence of any, significant error., From its chemical properties, radium is an element of, the group of alkaline earths, being the member next above, barium., From its atomic weight also, radium takes its place in, Mendeleeff’s table after barium with the alkaline earth, metals, in the row which already contains uranium and, thorium., Characteristics of the"

For this purpose we fractionated, a great quantity of commercial barium chloride, in, the hope of thus concentrating the trace of radium chloride, if such were present., Fifty kilos. of commercial barium chloride were dissolved, in water; the solution was precipitated by hydrochloric, acid free from sulphuric acid, which yielded 20 kilos. of the, precipitated chloride.

This was dissolved in water and, partially precipitated by hydrochloric acid, which gave 8·5, kilos. of precipitated chloride. This chloride was fractionated, by the method used for the barium chloride containing, radium; and at the end of the process, 10 grams of, chloride were obtained, corresponding to the least soluble, part. This chloride showed no radio-activity; it therefore, 31, contained no radium; this substance is, consequently, absent from the ores of barium., CHAPTER III., Radiation of the New Radio-active Substances., Methods of Investigation of the Radiation., In order to investigate the radiation emitted by radio-active, bodies, any one of the properties of this radiation, can be utilised. Thus the action of the rays on photographic, plates may serve, or their property of ionisation, of the air, which renders it a conductor, or their capacity, for causing fluorescence of certain bodies. Henceforth, in, speaking of these different methods of working, I shall use, the expressions radiographic method, electrical method, fluoroscopic method., The first two have been used from the beginning in the, study of uranium rays; the fluoroscopic method can only, be applied in the case of the new bodies which are strongly, radio-active, for the feebly active bodies such as uranium, and thorium produce no appreciable fluorescence.

"I shall use, the expressions radiographic method, electrical method, fluoroscopic method., The first two have been used from the beginning in the, study of uranium rays; the fluoroscopic method can only, be applied in the case of the new bodies which are strongly, radio-active, for the feebly active bodies such as uranium, and thorium produce no appreciable fluorescence. The, electrical method is the only one which serves for exact, determinations of intensity; the other two are specially, adapted for giving qualitative results, and only furnish, rough approximations. The results obtained with the three, methods just considered are not strictly comparable the one, with the other. The sensitive plate, the gas which is, ionised, the fluorescent screen, are in reality receivers, which absorb the energy of the radiation, and transform it, into another kind of energy, chemical energy, ionic energy, or luminous energy. Each receiver absorbs a fraction of, the radiation, which depends essentially upon its nature., Later on, we shall see that the radiation is complex, that, the fractions of the radiation absorbed by the different, receivers may differ among themselves both quantitatively, and qualitatively. Finally, it is neither evident, nor even, probable, that the energy absorbed is entirely transformed, by the receiver into the form that we wish for observation;, part of this energy may be transformed into heat, into the, evolution of secondary radiations which may or may not, assist in the production of the observed phenomenon, into chemical action which differs from that under observation, &c., and here also the effective action of"
"probable, that the energy absorbed is entirely transformed, by the receiver into the form that we wish for observation;, part of this energy may be transformed into heat, into the, evolution of secondary radiations which may or may not, assist in the production of the observed phenomenon, into chemical action which differs from that under observation, &c., and here also the effective action of the, receiver, with reference to the end we have in view, depends essentially upon the nature of that receiver., Let us compare two radio-active substances, one containing, 32, radium and the other polonium, and which show an, equal degree of activity in the condenser of Fig. 1. If each, is covered with a thin leaf of aluminium, the second appears, considerably less active than the first, and the same is the, case when they are placed under the same fluorescent, screen, if the latter is of sufficient thickness, or is placed, at a certain distance from the two radio-active bodies., Energy of Radiation., Whatever be the method of research employed, the, energy of radiation of the new radio-active substances is, always found to be considerably greater than that of, uranium and thorium. Thus it is that, at a short distance, they act instantaneously upon a photographic plate, whereas an exposure of twenty-four hours is necessary, when operating with uranium and thorium. A fluorescent, screen is vividly illuminated by contact with the new radio-active, bodies, whilst no trace of luminosity is visible with, uranium and thorium. Finally, the ionising action upon, air is"
"of, uranium and thorium. Thus it is that, at a short distance, they act instantaneously upon a photographic plate, whereas an exposure of twenty-four hours is necessary, when operating with uranium and thorium. A fluorescent, screen is vividly illuminated by contact with the new radio-active, bodies, whilst no trace of luminosity is visible with, uranium and thorium. Finally, the ionising action upon, air is considerably stronger in the ratio of 10, 6, approximately., But it is, strictly speaking, not possible to estimate the, total intensity of the radiation, as in the case of uranium, by the electrical method described at the beginning (Fig., 1). With uranium, for example, the radiation is almost, completely absorbed by the layer of air between the plates, and the limiting current is reached at a tension of 100, volts. But the case is different for strongly radio-active, bodies. One portion of the radiation of radium consists of, very penetrating rays, which penetrate the condenser and, the metallic plates, and are not utilised in ionising the air, between the plates. Further, the limiting current cannot, always be obtained for the tensions supplied; for example, with very active polonium the current remains proportional, to the tension between 100 and 500 volts. Therefore the, experimental conditions which give a simple interpretation, are not realised, and, consequently, the numbers obtained, cannot be taken as representing the measurement of the, total radiation; they merely point to a rough approximation., Complex Nature of the Radiation., The researches of various physicists (MM.

Therefore the, experimental conditions which give a simple interpretation, are not realised, and, consequently, the numbers obtained, cannot be taken as representing the measurement of the, total radiation; they merely point to a rough approximation., Complex Nature of the Radiation., The researches of various physicists (MM. Becquerel, Meyer and von Schweidler, Giesel, Villard, Rutherford, M. and Mdme. Curie) have proved the complex nature of, the radiation of radio-active bodies. It will be convenient, to specify three kinds of rays, which I shall denote, 33, according to the notation adopted by Mr. Rutherford, by the, letters α, β, γ., I. The α-rays are very slightly penetrating, and appear, to constitute the principal part of the radiation. These, rays are characterised by the laws by which they are, absorbed by matter. The magnetic field acts very slightly, upon them, and they were formerly thought to be quite, unaffected by the action of this field. However, in a strong, magnetic field, the α-rays are slightly deflected; the deflection, is caused in the same manner as with cathode rays, but the direction of the deflection is reversed; it is the same, as for the canal rays of the Crookes tubes., II. The β-rays are less absorbable as a whole than the, preceding ones. They are deflected by a magnetic field in, the same manner and direction as cathode rays., III. The γ-rays are penetrating rays, unaffected by the, magnetic field, and comparable to Röntgen rays., Fig. 4., Consider"

They are deflected by a magnetic field in, the same manner and direction as cathode rays., III. The γ-rays are penetrating rays, unaffected by the, magnetic field, and comparable to Röntgen rays., Fig. 4., Consider the following imaginary experiment:—Some, radium, R, is placed at the bottom of a small deep cavity, hollowed in a, block of lead, P, (Fig. 4). A sheaf, of rays, rectilinear, and, slightly expanded, streams, from the receptacle., Let us, suppose that a, strong uniform, magnetic field is, established in, the neighbourhood, of the receptacle, normal, to the plane, of the figure and, directed towards, the back., The three groups of rays, α, β, γ, will now be separated., Then rather faint γ-rays continue in their straight, path without a trace of deviation. The β-rays are, deflected in the manner of cathode rays, and describe, circular paths in the plane of the figure. If the receptacle, is placed on a photographic plate, A C, the portion, B C, of, the plate which receives the β-rays is acted upon. Lastly, 34, the α-rays form a very intense shaft which is slightly, deflected, and which is soon absorbed by the air. These, rays describe in the plane of the figure a path of great, curvature, the direction of the deflection being the reverse, of that with the β-rays., If the receptacle is covered with a"

These, rays describe in the plane of the figure a path of great, curvature, the direction of the deflection being the reverse, of that with the β-rays., If the receptacle is covered with a thin sheet of aluminium, (0·1 m.m. thick), the α-rays are suppressed almost entirely, the β-rays are lessened, and the γ-rays do not appear to be, absorbed to any great extent., Action of the Magnetic Field., We have seen that the rays emitted by radio-active, bodies have many properties common to cathode rays, and to Röntgen rays. Cathode rays, as well as Röntgen, rays, ionise the air, act on photographic plates, cause, fluorescence, undergo no regular deflection. But the, cathode rays differ from Röntgen rays in being deflected, from their rectilinear path by the action of the magnetic, field, and in the transportation of charges of negative, electricity., The fact that the magnetic field acts upon the rays, emitted by radio-active substances was discovered almost, simultaneously by MM. Giesel, Meyer and von Schweidler, and Becquerel. These physicists observed that the rays, of radio-active substances are deflected by the magnetic, field in the same manner and direction as the cathode, rays; their observations were in relation to the β-rays., M.

"Meyer and von Schweidler, and Becquerel. These physicists observed that the rays, of radio-active substances are deflected by the magnetic, field in the same manner and direction as the cathode, rays; their observations were in relation to the β-rays., M. Curie demonstrated that the radiation of radium, comprises two groups of quite distinct rays, of which one is, readily deflected by the magnetic field (β-rays), whilst the, other seems to be unaffected by the action of this field (α-, and γ-rays)., M. Becquerel did not find that the specimens of polonium, prepared by us emitted rays of the cathode kind. On the, contrary, he first noticed the effect of the magnetic field on, a specimen of polonium prepared by himself. None of the, polonium prepared by us ever gave rise to rays of the, cathode order., The polonium of M. Giesel only gives rise to these rays, when recently prepared, and it is probable that the emission, is due to the phenomenon of induced radio-activity of which, we shall speak later., The following are experiments which prove that one, portion of the radiation of radium, and one portion only, consists of easily deflected rays (β-rays). These experiments, were done according to the electrical method., 35, The radio-active body, A, (Fig. 5) sends forth radiations, in the direction, A D, between the plates, P, and, P′, .

The plate, P, is now at a potential of 500 volts, plate, P′, is connected to, an electrometer and to a quartz electric piezometer. The, intensity of the current passing through the air under the, influence of the radiations is measured. The magnetic, field can be established at will perpendicular to the plane, of the figure over the whole region, E E E E, . If the rays are, deflected, even slightly, they no longer pass between the, plates, and the current is suppressed. The region of the, passage of the rays is surrounded with masses of lead, B, B′, B″, and by the armatures of the, electro-magnet; when the rays are deflected, they are absorbed by the masses, of lead, B, and, B′, ., Fig. 5., The results obtained depend essentially, on the distance, A D, of the radiating substance, A, from the condenser at, D, . If, the distance, A D, is great enough (greater, than 7 c.m.), most of the radium rays (90, to 100 per cent) arriving at the condenser, are deflected and suppressed for a field of, 2500 units. These are the β-rays. If the, distance, A D, is less than 65 m.m., a, smaller part of the rays are deflected by, the action of the field; this portion is also, entirely deflected by a field of"
"7 c.m.), most of the radium rays (90, to 100 per cent) arriving at the condenser, are deflected and suppressed for a field of, 2500 units. These are the β-rays. If the, distance, A D, is less than 65 m.m., a, smaller part of the rays are deflected by, the action of the field; this portion is also, entirely deflected by a field of 2500 units, and the proportion of the rays suppressed, is not increased by increasing the field from 2500 to, 7000 units., The proportion of the rays not suppressed by the field, increases with decrease of the distance, A D, between the, radiating body and the condenser. For small distances, the rays which can be easily deflected form a very small, fraction of the total radiation. The penetrating rays are, therefore, for the most part, deviable rays of the cathode, order (β-rays)., Under the experimental conditions just described, the, action of the magnetic field on the α-rays could not be well, observed for the fields employed. The chief radiation, apparently undergoing no deflection, observed at a short, distance from the radiating source, consisted of α-rays; the, undeflected radiation observed at a greater distance consisted, of γ-rays., If an absorbing lamina (aluminium or black paper) is, placed in the path of the bundle of rays, those which pass, 36, through are nearly all deflected by the field in such a way, that, with the aid of the screen and the magnetic field, almost all the radiation is suppressed in the condenser, the, remainder being"

The α-rays are absorbed by the screen., An aluminium plate of 1/100 m.m. thickness is sufficient, for the suppression of almost all the rays not readily, deflected when the substance is far enough from the condenser;, for smaller distances (34 m.m. and 51 m.m.) two pieces, of this aluminium foil are necessary to give the same result., Similar determinations were made with four substances, containing radium (chlorides or carbonates) of very different, activity; analogous results were obtained., It may be remarked that, in all cases, the penetrating, rays deflected by the magnet (β-rays) form only a small, fraction of the total radiation; they influence but slightly, the determinations in which the whole radiation is made, use of to produce conductivity of the air., The radiation emitted by polonium may be studied by, the electrical method.

The, radiation of polonium is apparently limited in space, and, does not pass into the air beyond a kind of sheath surrounding, the substance to a thickness of several centimetres., The interpretation of the experiments I have just, described must be accompanied by some important general, reservations. In speaking of the proportion of the rays, deflected by the magnet, I refer only to that portion of the, radiation capable of causing a current in the condenser. In, employing the fluorescent action of the Becquerel rays, or, their action on photographic plates, the proportion would, probably be different—a measure of intensity having, as a, rule, no meaning except for the method of measurement, adopted., The rays of polonium are α-rays. In the experiments, just described, I observed no action of the magnetic field, upon them, but the experimental conditions were such that, a slight deflection would pass unnoticed., The experiments made by the radiographic method confirmed, the preceding results.

Taking radium as the source, of radiation, and receiving the impression on a plate, 37, parallel to the primitive shaft and normal to the field, a, very clear print is obtained of two shafts separated by the, action of the field, the one deflected, the other not deflected., The β-rays constitute the deflected beam; the, α-rays, being very slightly deflected, are not to be distinguished, from the undeflected bundle of the γ-rays., Deflected β-Rays., The experiments of M. Giesel and MM. Meyer and von, Schweidler showed that the radiation of the radio-active, bodies is, in part at least, deflected by a magnetic field, and, that this deflection resembles that of the cathode rays. M., Becquerel investigated the action of the field on the rays, by the radiographic method. The experimental arrangement, was that of Fig. 4. The radium was placed in the, lead receptacle, P, and this receptacle was placed on the, sensitive face of a photographic plate, A C, covered with, black paper. The whole was placed between the poles of, an electro-magnet, the magnetic field being normal to the, plane of the figure., If the field is directed to the back of this plane, the part, B C, of the plate is acted upon by rays which, after having, described circular paths, return to"

These rays are β-rays., M. Becquerel has demonstrated that the impression, consists of a wide diffused band, a continuous spectrum, indeed, showing that the sheaf of deviable rays emitted by, the source is formed of an infinite number of radiations, unequally deflected. If the gelatin of the plate be covered, with different absorbent screens (paper, glass, metals), one, portion of the spectrum is suppressed, and it is found that, the rays most deflected by the magnetic field—otherwise, those which have the smallest radius of curvature—are the, most completely absorbed. With each screen, the impression, on the plate begins at a certain distance from the, source of radiation, this distance being proportional to the, absorptive power of the screen., Charge of the Deflected Rays., The cathode rays are, as shown by M. Perrin, charged, with negative electricity. Further, according to the experiments, of M. Perrin and M. Lenard, they are capable of, carrying their charge through the metallic envelopes connected, to earth and through isolating screens.

At every, point where the cathode rays are absorbed, there is a continuous, evolution of negative electricity. We have proved, 38, that the same is the case for the deflected β-rays of, radium., The deviable β-rays of radium are charged with, negative electricity., (, Note., —Let the radio-active substance be placed on one, of the plates of a condenser, this plate being connected to, earth; the second plate is connected to an electrometer, it, receives and absorbs the rays emitted by the substance. If, the rays are charged, a continuous flow of electricity into, the electrometer should be observed. In this experiment, carried out in air, we were not able to detect a charge, accompanying the rays, but such an experiment is not, delicate. The air between the plates being caused by the, rays to conduct, the electrometer is no longer isolated, and, can only respond to charges if these be sufficiently strong., In order that the α-rays may not interfere with the, experiment, they may be suppressed by covering the source, of radiation with a thin metallic screen.

We repeated this, experiment, without more success, by causing the rays, to pass through the interior of a Faraday cylinder in, connection with the electrometer)., According to the preceding experiments, it was evident, that the charge of the rays of the radiating body employed, was a weak one., In order to fix a feeble evolution of electricity upon the, conductor which absorbs the rays, this conductor should be, completely insulated; this is effected by screening it from, the air, either by placing it in a tube with a very perfect, vacuum, or by surrounding it with a good solid dielectric., We employed the latter arrangement., Fig. 6., A conducting disc, M M, (Fig. 6), is connected by the wire, t, to the electrometer;, the disc, and wire are completely, enveloped, by the insulating, substance, i i i i, ;, the whole is again, surrounded with, the metallic, covering, E E E E, which is in electric connection with the, earth.

The latter, 39, then becomes the source of a continuous evolution of, negative electricity, as determined by the electrometer, and, is measured by means of a quartz piezometer., The current thus created is very weak. With very, active barium-radium chloride, forming a layer of 2·5 sq., c.m. in area, and of 0·2 c.m. in thickness, a current of, magnitude 10, –11, ampères is obtained, the rays utilised, having traversed, before being absorbed by the disc, M M, a, thickness of aluminium of 0·01 m.m., and a thickness of, ebonite of 0·3 m.m., We used successively lead, copper, and zinc for the disc, M M, ebonite and paraffin for the insulator; the results, obtained were the same., The current diminishes with increasing distance from the, source of radiation, R, also when a less active product is used., We obtained the same results again when the disc, M M, is, replaced by a Faraday cylinder filled with air, and covered, outside with insulating material.

The radium, rays penetrate the thin dielectric plate, p p, and leave the, conductor inside carrying with them negative electricity., The α-rays of radium do not interfere in these experiments, being almost completely absorbed by a very thin layer of, matter. The method just described is not suitable for the study, of the charge of the rays of polonium, these rays very slightly, penetrating. We observed no indication of any charge in the, case of polonium, which gives rise to α-rays only; but, for, the reason just given, no conclusion can be drawn from this., 40, Thus, in the case of the deflected β-rays of radium, as, in the case of cathode rays, the rays carry a charge of, electricity.

But, hitherto, the existence of electric charges, uncombined with matter has been unknown. In the study, of the emission of the β-rays of radium, we are therefore, led to make use of the theory which is in vogue for the, study of cathode rays. In this ballistic theory, formulated, by Sir William Crookes, since developed and completed by, Prof. J. J. Thomson, the cathode rays consist of extremely, minute particles, which are hurled from the cathode with, great velocity, and which are charged with negative, electricity. We might similarly conceive that radium, sends into space negatively electrified particles., A specimen of radium, enclosed in a solid thin perfectly, insulated envelope, should become spontaneously charged, to a very high potential. By the ballistic hypothesis the, potential would increase until the potential difference of, the surrounding conductors became sufficient to hinder the, ejection of the electrified particles and to cause their return, to the source of radiation., We have performed an experiment on these lines. A, specimen of very active radium was enclosed for some time, in a glass vessel. In order to open the vessel, we made a, trace on the glass with a glass cutter.

A, specimen of very active radium was enclosed for some time, in a glass vessel. In order to open the vessel, we made a, trace on the glass with a glass cutter. Whilst so doing, we clearly heard the report of a spark, and upon examining, the vessel with a magnifying glass, we observed that the, glass had been pierced by a spark at the spot where it had, been weakened by the scratch. The phenomenon produced, is comparable to the rupture of the glass of an overcharged, Leyden jar., The same phenomenon occurred with another glass., Further, at the moment of the passing of the spark, M., Curie, who was holding the glass, felt the electric shock of, discharge in his fingers., Certain kinds of glass have good insulating properties., If the radium is enclosed in a sealed glass vessel, well, insulated, it is to be expected that, at a given moment, the, vessel will be spontaneously perforated., Radium is the first example of a body which is spontaneously, charged with electricity., Action of the Electric Field upon the Deflected β-Rays of Radium., The β-rays of radium, being analogous to the cathode, rays, should be deflected by an electric field in a manner, similar to the latter;, i.e., as would a particle of matter, 41, negatively charged and hurled into space with a great, velocity.

The existence of such a deflection has been, demonstrated both by M. Dorn and M. Becquerel., Let us consider the case of a ray which traverses the, space situated between the two plates of a condenser., Suppose the direction of the ray parallel to the plates: when, an electric field is established between the latter, the ray is, subjected to the action of this uniform field along its whole, path in the condenser l. By reason of this action the ray, is deflected towards the positive plate and describes the arc, of a parabola; on leaving the field, it continues its path in, a straight line, following the tangent to the arc of the, parabola at the point of exit. The ray can be received on, a photographic plate perpendicular to its original direction., Observations are taken of the impression produced on the, plate when the field is zero, and when it has a known, value, and from that is deduced the value of the deflection, δ, which is the distance of the points in which the new, direction of the ray and its original direction meet a, common plane perpendicular to the original direction.

If, h is the distance of this plane from the condenser, i.e., at, the edge of the field, we have, by a simple calculation, —, m, being the mass of the moving particles, e, its charge, v, its, velocity, and F the strength of the field., The experiments of M.

Becquerel threw the first light, upon this subject. They gave for the ratio, e, m, a value approximately, equal to 10, 7, absolute electro-magnetic units, and for v a magnitude of 1·6 × 10, 10, . These values are of the, same order of magnitude as those of the cathode rays., Accurate experiments have been made on the same subject, by M. Kaufmann. This physicist subjected a narrow beam, of radium rays to the simultaneous action of an electric field, and a magnetic field, the two fields being uniform and having, a similar direction, normal to the original direction of the, beam. The impression produced on a plate normal to the, primitive beam and placed beyond the limits of the field with, reference to the source, has the form of a curve, each point, of which corresponds to one of the original beam. The, most penetrating and least deflected rays are at the same, time those with the greatest velocity., It follows from the experiments of M. Kaufmann, that for, the radium rays, of which the velocity is considerably greater, than that of the cathode rays, the ratio, e, m, decreases, while, the velocity increases., According to the researches of J.

Kaufmann, that for, the radium rays, of which the velocity is considerably greater, than that of the cathode rays, the ratio, e, m, decreases, while, the velocity increases., According to the researches of J. J. Thomson and Townsend, we may assume that the moving particle, which constitutes, the ray, possesses a charge, e, equal to that carried by, an atom of hydrogen during electrolysis, this charge being, the same for all the rays. We are therefore led to the conclusion, that the mass of the particle, m, increases with, increase of velocity., These theoretical considerations lead to the idea that the, inertia of the particle is due to its state of charge during, motion, the velocity of an electric charge in motion being, incapable of modification without expenditure of energy. To, state it otherwise, the inertia of the particle is of electro-magnetic, origin, and the mass of the particle is—in part at, least—a virtual mass or an electro-magnetic mass. M., Abraham goes further, and assumes that the mass of the, particle is entirely an electro-magnetic mass. If, according, to this hypothesis, the value of this mass, m, be calculated, for a known velocity, v, we find that, m, approaches infinity, when, v, approaches the velocity of light, and that, m, approaches, a constant value when the velocity, v, is much less than that, of light.

The experiments of M. Kaufmann are in agreement, with the results of this theory, the importance of which is, great because it foreshadows the possibility of establishing, 43, mechanical bases upon the dynamical of little particles of, matter charged in a state of motion., These are the figures obtained by M.

Kaufmann’s experiments, certain β-rays, of radium possess a velocity very near to that of light., These rapid rays seem to possess great penetrating capacity, towards matter., Action of the Magnetic Field upon the α-Rays., In a recent work, Mr. Rutherford announced that, in a, powerful electric or magnetic field, the α-rays of radium are, slightly deflected, in the manner of particles positively electrified, and possessing great velocity. Mr. Rutherford concludes, from his experiments that the velocity of the α-rays is of the, order of magnitude 2·5 × 10, 9, c.m., sec., and that the ratio, e, m, for, these rays is of the order of magnitude 6 × 10, 3, which is 10, 4, times as great as for the deflected β-rays. We shall see, later that these conclusions of Mr. Rutherford are in agreement, with the properties already known of the α-radiation, and that they account, in part at least, for the law of absorption, of this radiation., The experiments of Mr. Rutherford have been confirmed, by M. Becquerel. M. Becquerel has further demonstrated, that polonium rays behave in a magnetic field like the α-rays, 44, of radium, and that, for the same field, they seem to have, the same curvature as"

The private schools directed by Poles were closely watched by the police and overburdened with the necessity of teaching the Russian language even to children so young that they could scarcely speak their native Polish. Nevertheless, since the teachers were nearly all of Polish nationality, they endeavored in every possible way to mitigate the difficulties resulting from the national persecution. These schools, however, could not legally give diplomas, which were obtainable only in the schools of the government. These schools, entirely Russian, were directly opposed to the Polish national spirit. All instruction was given in Russian, by Russian professors, who, being hostile to the Polish nation, treated their pupils as enemies. Men of moral and intellectual distinction could scarcely agree to teach in schools where an alien attitude was forced upon them. So what the pupils were taught was of questionable value, and the moral atmosphere was altogether unbearable. Constantly held in suspicion and spied upon, the children knew that a single conversation in Polish, or an imprudent word, might seriously harm, not only themselves, but also their families. Amidst these hostilities, they lost all the joy of life, and precocious feelings of distrust and indignation weighed upon their childhood. On the other side, this abnormal situation resulted in exciting the patriotic feeling of Polish youths to the highest degree.(from Autobiographical Notes pp. 158-159.)"

"I was only fifteen when I finished my high-school studies, always having held first rank in my class. The fatigue of growth and study compelled me to take almost a year’s rest in the country. I then returned to my father in Warsaw, hoping to teach in the free schools. But family circumstances obliged me to change my decision. My father, now aged and tired, needed rest; his fortune was very modest. So I resolved to accept a position as governess for several children. Thus, when scarcely seventeen, I left my father’s house to begin an independent life. That going away remains one of the most vivid memories of my youth. My heart was heavy as I climbed into the railway car. It was to carry me for several hours, away from those I loved. And after the railway journey I must drive for five hours longer. What experience was awaiting me? So I questioned as I sat close to the car window looking out across the wide plains.(from Autobiographical Notes p. 163.)"
"I continued my efforts to educate myself. This was no easy task under the Russian government of Warsaw; yet I found more opportunities than in the country. To my great joy, I was able, for the first time in my life, to find access to a laboratory: a small municipal physical laboratory directed by one of my cousins. I found little time to work there, except in the evenings and on Sundays, and was generally left to myself. I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success, at others I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience. But on the whole, though I was taught that the way of progress is neither swift nor easy, this first trial confirmed in me the taste for experimental research in the fields of physics and chemistry. Other means of instruction came to me through my being one of an enthusiastic group of young men and women of Warsaw, who united in a common desire to study, and whose activities were at the same time social and patriotic. It was one of those groups of Polish youths who believed that the hope of their country lay in a great effort to develop the intellectual and moral strength of the nation, and that such an effort would lead to a better national situation. The nearest purpose was to work at one’s own instruction"
"whose activities were at the same time social and patriotic. It was one of those groups of Polish youths who believed that the hope of their country lay in a great effort to develop the intellectual and moral strength of the nation, and that such an effort would lead to a better national situation. The nearest purpose was to work at one’s own instruction and to provide means of instruction for workmen and peasants. In accordance with this program we agreed among ourselves to give evening courses, each one teaching what he knew best. There is no need to say that this was a secret organization, which made everything extremely difficult. There were in our group very devoted young people who, as I still believe today, could do truly useful work. I have a bright remembrance of the sympathetic intellectual and social companionship which I enjoyed at that time. Truly the means of action were poor and the results obtained could not be considerable; yet I still believe that the ideas which inspired us then are the only way to real social progress. You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 167-168.)"

"It would be impossible to tell of all the good these years brought to me. Undistracted by any outside occupation, I was entirely absorbed in the joy of learning and understanding. Yet, all the while, my living conditions were far from easy, my own funds being small and my family not having the means to aid me as they would have liked to do. However, my situation was not exceptional; it was the familiar experience of many of the Polish students whom I knew. The room I lived in was in a garret, very cold in winter, for it was insufficiently heated by a small stove which often lacked coal. During a particularly rigorous winter, it was not unusual for the water to freeze in the basin in the night; to be able to sleep I was obliged to pile all my clothes on the bedcovers. In the same room I prepared my meals with the aid of an alcohol lamp and a few kitchen utensils. These meals were often reduced to bread with a cup of chocolate, eggs or fruit. I had no help in housekeeping and I myself carried the little coal I used up the six flights. This life, painful from certain points of view, had, for all that, a real charm for me. It gave me a very precious sense of liberty and independence. Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the feeling of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid, did not at all"
"little coal I used up the six flights. This life, painful from certain points of view, had, for all that, a real charm for me. It gave me a very precious sense of liberty and independence. Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the feeling of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid, did not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome, my usual state of mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction. All my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the beginning, were difficult. In fact, I was insufficiently prepared to follow the physical science course at the Sorbonne, for, despite all my efforts, I had not succeeded in acquiring in Poland a preparation as complete as that of the French students following the same course. So I was obliged to supply this deficiency, especially in mathematics. I divided my time between courses, experimental work, and study in the library. In the evening I worked in my room, sometimes very late into the night. All that I saw and learned that was new delighted me. It was like a new world opened to me, the world of science, which I was at last permitted to know in all liberty.(from Autobiographical Notes pp. 170-171.)I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894....

A Polish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre Curie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and his wife. As I entered the room, Pierre Curie was standing in the recess of a French window opening on a balcony. He seemed to me very young, though he was at that time thirty-five years old. I was struck by the open expression of his face and by the slight suggestion of detachment in his whole attitude. His speech, rather slow and deliberate, his simplicity, and his smile, at once grave and youthful, inspired confidence. We began a conversation which soon became friendly. It first concerned certain scientific matters about which I was very glad to be able to ask his opinion. Then we discussed certain social and humanitarian subjects which interested us both. There was, between his conceptions and mine, despite the difference between our native countries, a surprising kinship, no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral atmosphere in which we were both raised by our families. We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked if he might call upon me.... Pierre Curie came to see me, and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life."

We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked if he might call upon me.... Pierre Curie came to see me, and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and he asked me to share that life. It was not, however, easy for me to make such a decision, for it meant separation from my country and my family, and the renouncement of certain social projects that were dear to me. Having grown up in an atmosphere of patriotism kept alive by the oppression of Poland, I wished, like many other young people of my country, to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national spirit.... During the year 1894 Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was.... It is appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the possibility of our marriage: “We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have, the one for"
"concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was.... It is appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the possibility of our marriage: “We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have, the one for the other, at least a great affection. Provided that you do not change your mind! For there are no promises which hold; these are things that do not admit of compulsion. “It would, nevertheless, be a beautiful thing in which I hardly dare believe, to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your dream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science. Of all these dreams, I believe the last, alone, is legitimate. I mean to say by this that we are powerless to change the social order. Even if this were not true we should not know what to do.... From the point of view of science, on the contrary, we can pretend to accomplish something. The territory here is more solid and obvious, and however small it is, it is truly in our possession.” One can understand, from this letter, that for Pierre Curie there was only one way of looking at the future. He had dedicated his life to his dream of science: he felt the need of a companion who could live his dream with him (from Pierre Curie pp. 72-77.)"

"It became a serious problem how to take care of our little Irène and of our home without giving up my scientific work. Such a renunciation would have been very painful to me, and my husband would not even think of it; he used to say that he had got a wife made expressly for him to share all his preoccupations. Neither of us would contemplate abandoning what was so precious to both. Of course we had to have a servant, but I personally saw to all the details of the child’s care. While I was in the laboratory, she was in the care of her grandfather, who loved her tenderly and whose own life was made brighter by her. So the close union of our family enabled me to meet my obligations. Things were particularly difficult only in case of more exceptional events, such as a child’s illness, when sleepless nights interrupted the normal course of life. It can be easily understood that there was no place in our life for worldly relations. We saw but a few friends, scientific workers, like ourselves, with whom we talked in our home or in our garden, while I did some sewing for my little girl. We also maintained affectionate relations with my husband’s brother and his family. But I was separated from all my relatives, as my sister had left Paris with her husband to live in Poland. It was under this mode of quiet living, organized according to our desires, that we achieved the great work"

"My experiments proved that the radiation of uranium compounds can be measured with precision under determined conditions, and that this radiation is an atomic property of the element of uranium. Its intensity is proportional to the quantity of uranium contained in the compound, and depends neither on conditions of chemical combination, nor on external circumstances, such as light or temperature. I undertook next to discover if there were other elements possessing the same property, and with this aim I examined all the elements then known, either in their pure state or in compounds. I found that among these bodies, thorium compounds are the only ones which emit rays similar to those of uranium. The radiation of thorium has an intensity of the same order as that of uranium, and is, as in the case of uranium, an atomic property of the element.... During the course of my research, I had had occasion to examine not only simple compounds, salts and oxides, but also a great number of minerals. Certain ones proved radioactive; these were those containing uranium and thorium; but their radioactivity seemed abnormal, for it was much greater than the amount I had found in uranium and thorium had led me to expect. This abnormality greatly surprised us. When I had assured myself that it was not due to an error in the experiment, it became necessary to find an explanation. I then made the hypothesis that the ores uranium and thorium contain in small quantity a substance much more strongly radioactive than either uranium"
"I had found in uranium and thorium had led me to expect. This abnormality greatly surprised us. When I had assured myself that it was not due to an error in the experiment, it became necessary to find an explanation. I then made the hypothesis that the ores uranium and thorium contain in small quantity a substance much more strongly radioactive than either uranium or thorium. This substance could not be one of the known elements, because these had already been examined; it must, therefore, be a new chemical element. I had a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible. And Pierre Curie, keenly interested in the question, abandoned his work on crystals (provisionally, he thought) to join me in the search for this unknown substance. We chose, for our work, the ore pitchblende, a uranium ore, which in its pure state is about four times more active than oxide of uranium. Since the composition of this ore was known through very careful chemical analysis, we could expect to find, at a maximum, 1 per cent of new substance. The result of our experiment proved that there were in reality new radioactive elements in pitchblende, but that their proportion did not reach even a millionth per cent!(from Pierre Curie pp. 96-98.)"

"The School of Physics could give us no suitable premises, but for lack of anything better, the Director permitted us to use an abandoned shed which had been in service as a dissecting room of the School of Medicine. Its glass roof did not afford complete shelter against rain; the heat was suffocating in summer, and the bitter cold of winter was only a little lessened by the iron stove, except in its immediate vicinity. There was no question of obtaining the needed proper apparatus in common use by chemists. We simply had some old pine-wood tables with furnaces and gas burners. We had to use the adjoining yard for those of our chemical operations that involved producing irritating gases; even then the gas often filled our shed. With this equipment we entered on our exhausting work. Yet it was in this miserable old shed that we passed the best and happiest years of our life, devoting our entire days to our work. Often I had to prepare our lunch in the shed, so as not to interrupt some particularly important operation. Sometimes I had to spend a whole day mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the day’s end. Other days, on the contrary, the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional crystallization, in the effort to concentrate the radium.

"boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the day’s end. Other days, on the contrary, the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional crystallization, in the effort to concentrate the radium. I was then annoyed by the floating dust of iron and coal from which I could not protect my precious products. But I shall never be able to express the joy of the untroubled quietness of this atmosphere of research and the excitement of actual progress with the confident hope of still better results. The feeling of discouragement that sometimes came after some unsuccessful toil did not last long and gave way to renewed activity. We had happy moments devoted to a quiet discussion of our work, walking around our shed. One of our joys was to go into our workroom at night; we then perceived on all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes of the bottles or capsules containing our products. It was really a lovely sight and one always new to us. The glowing tubes looked like faint, fairy lights. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 186-187.)"
"The first experiments on the biological properties of radium were successfully made in France with samples from our laboratory, while my husband was living. The results were, at once, encouraging, so that the new branch of medical science, called radiumtherapy (in France, Curietherapy), developed rapidly, first in France and later in other countries. To supply the radium wanted for this purpose, a radium-producing industry was established. The first plant was created in France and worked very successfully, but afterwards manufactures were founded in other countries, the most important of which are now in America, where great quantities of radium ore, named “carnotite,” are available. The radiumtherapy and the radium production developed conjointly, and the results were more and more important for the treatment of several diseases, and particularly of cancer. As a consequence of this, several institutes have been founded, in the large cities, for the application of the new therapy. Some of these institutes own several grams of radium, the commercial price of the gram being now about $70,000, the cost of production depending on the very small proportion of radium in the ore. It may be easily understood how deeply I appreciated the privilege of realizing that our discovery had become a benefit to mankind, not only through its great scientific importance, but also by its power of efficient action against human suffering and terrible disease. This was indeed a splendid reward for our years of hard toil. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 199-200.)"

"In 1903 I finished my doctor's thesis and obtained the degree. At the end of the same year the Nobel prize was awarded jointly to Becquerel, my husband and me for the discovery of radioactivity and new radioactive elements. This event greatly increased the publicity of our work. For some time there was no more peace. Visitors and demands for lectures and articles interrupted every day....The fatigue resulting from the effort exceeding our forces, imposed by the unsatisfactory conditions of our labor, was augmented by the invasion of publicity. The overturn of our voluntary isolation was a cause of real suffering for us and had all the effect of disaster. It was serious trouble brought into the organization of our life, and I have already explained how indispensable was our freedom from external distraction, in order to maintain our family life and our scientific activity. Of course, people who contribute to that kind of trouble generally mean it kindly. It is only that they do not realize the conditions of the problem.(from Autobiographical Notes pp. 190-191.)"
"In 1906 just as we were definitely giving up the old shed laboratory where we had been so happy, there came the dreadful catastrophe which took my husband away from me and left me alone to bring up our children and, at the same time, to continue our work of research. It is impossible for me to express the profoundness and importance of the crisis brought into my life by the loss of the one who had been my closest companion and best friend. Crushed by the blow, I did not feel able to face the future. I could not forget, however, what my husband used sometimes to say, that, even deprived of him, I ought to continue my work. The death of my husband, coming immediately after the general knowledge of the discoveries with which his name is associated, was felt by the public, and especially by the scientific circles, to be a national misfortune. It was largely under the influence of this emotion that the Faculty of Sciences of Paris decided to offer me the chair, as professor, which my husband had occupied only one year and a half in the Sorbonne. It was an exceptional decision, as up to then no woman had held such a position.... The honor that now came to me was deeply painful under the cruel circumstances of its coming.

"We put you into the coffin Saturday morning, and I held your head up for this move. We kissed your cold face for the last time. Then a few periwinkles from the garden on the coffin and the little picture of me that you called “the good little student” and that you loved. It is the picture that must go with you into the grave, the picture of her who had the happiness of pleasing you enough so that you did not hesitate to offer to share your life with her, even when you had seen her only a few times. You often told me that this was the only occasion in your life when you acted without hesitation, with the absolute conviction that you were doing well. My Pierre, I think you were not wrong. We were made to live together, and our union had to be. Your coffin was closed and I could see you no more. I didn’t allow them to cover it with the horrible black cloth. I covered it with flowers and I sat beside it.... They filled the grave and put sheaves of flowers on it. Everything is over, Pierre is sleeping his last sleep beneath the earth; it is the end of everything, everything, everything. I am working in the laboratory all day long, it is all I can do; I am better off there than anywhere else.

(from Madame Curie p. 249.)"
"The dominant duty imposed on everyone at that time was to help the country in whatever way possible during the extreme crisis that it faced. No general instructions to this were given to the members of the University. It was left to each to take his own initiative and means of action.... During the rapid succession of events in August 1914, it was clearly proved that the preparation for defense was insufficient. Public feeling was especially aroused by the realization of the grave failings which appeared in the organization of the Health Service. My own attention was particularly drawn to this situation, and I soon found a field of activity which, once entered upon, absorbed the greatest part of my time and efforts until the end of the war, and even for some time thereafter.... It is well known that the X-rays offer surgeons and doctors extremely useful means for the examination of the sick and wounded.... However, at the beginning of the war, the Military Board of Health had no organization of radiology, while the civil organization was also but little developed. Radiologic installations existed in only a small number of important hospitals, and there were only a few specialists in the large cities. The numerous new hospitals that were established all over France in the first months of the war had, as a rule, no installation for the use of X-rays.

"important hospitals, and there were only a few specialists in the large cities. The numerous new hospitals that were established all over France in the first months of the war had, as a rule, no installation for the use of X-rays. To meet this need I first gathered together all the apparatus I could find in the laboratories and stores. With this equipment I established in August and September, 1914, several stations of radiology, the operation of which was assured by volunteer helpers to whom I gave instruction. These stations rendered great service during the battle of the Marne. But as they could not satisfy the needs of all the hospitals of the Paris region, I fitted up, with the help of the Red Cross, a radiologic car. It was simply a touring motor-car, arranged for the transport of a complete radiologic apparatus, together with a dynamo that was worked by the engine of the car, and furnished the electric current necessary for the production of the rays. This car could come at the call of any of the hospitals, large or small, in the surroundings of Paris. Cases of urgent need were frequent, for these hospitals had to take care of the wounded who could not be transported to more distant places. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 208-211.)"

"The story of radiology in war offers a striking example of the unsuspected amplitude that the application of purely scientific discoveries can take under certain conditions. X rays had had only a limited usefulness up to the time of the war. The great catastrophe which was let loose upon humanity, accumulating its victims in terrifying numbers, brought up by reaction the ardent desire to save everything that could be saved and to exploit every means of sparing and protecting human life. At once there appeared an effort to make the X ray yield its maximum of service. What had seemed difficult became easy and received an immediate solution. The material and the personnel were multiplied as if by enchantment. All those who did not understand gave in or accepted; those who did not know learned; those who had been indifferent became devoted. Thus the scientific discovery achieved the conquest of its natural field of action. A similar evolution took place in radiumtherapy, or the medical application of radiations emitted by the radio elements. What are we to conclude from this unhoped-for development shared between the new radiations revealed to us by science at the end of the nineteenth century? It seems that they must make our confidence in disinterested research more alive and increase our reverence and admiration for it. (from Madame Curie p. 306.)"

"As you have seen, fortune favors us at this moment; but these favors of fortune do not come without many worries. We have never been less tranquil than at this moment. There are days when we scarcely have time to breathe. And to think that we dreamed of living in the wild, quite removed from human beings! (Letters from Pierre Curie to his friend E. Gouy, 20 March 1902)"
"I have wanted to write to you for a long time; excuse me if I have not done so. The cause is the stupid life which I lead at present. You have seen this sudden infatuation for radium, which has resulted for us in all the advantages of a moment of popularity. We have been pursued by journalists and photographers from all countries of the world; they have gone even so far as to report the conversation between my daughter and her nurse, and to describe the black- and-white cat that lives with us.... Further, we have had a great many appeals for money.... Finally, the collectors of autographs, snobs, society people, and even at times, scientists, have come to see us—in our magnificent and tranquil quarters in the laboratory—and every evening there has been a voluminous correspondence to send off. With such a state of things I feel myself invaded by a kind of stupor. And yet all this turmoil will not perhaps have been in vain, if it results in my getting a chair and a laboratory. (22 January 1904)"
"We have regretted so much being deprived of your visit this year, but hope to see you in October. If we do not make an effort from time to time, we end by losing touch with our best and most congenial friends, and in keeping company with others for the simple reason that it is easy to meet them. We continue to lead the same life of people who are extremely occupied, without being able to accomplish anything interesting. It is now more than a year since I have been able to engage in any research, and I have no moment to myself. Clearly I have not yet discovered a means to defend ourselves against this frittering away of our time which is nevertheless extremely necessary. Intellectually, it is a question of life or death. (25 July 1905)"
"I am neither very well, nor very ill; but I am easily fatigued, and I have left but very little capacity for work. My wife, on the contrary, leads a very active life, between her children, the School at Sèvres, and the laboratory. She does not lose a minute, and occupies herself more regularly than I can with the direction of the laboratory in which she passes the greater part of the day. (7 November 1905)"
"Paris, Monday, 31 August 1914 (At this time the German Army was threatening Paris). Dear Irène, I’ve just received your sweet letter of Saturday and I wanted so much to hug you that I almost cried. This morning I was able to make my way to the train station where Fernand and Margaret were to leave—and I didn’t manage to see them. I wonder if they’ve left. Things are not going very well, and we all have a heavy heart and disturbed spirit. We need great courage and I hope we will not lack it. We must keep the firm hope that after these bad days, good times will return. It’s in that hope that I lock you in my heart, my beloved daughters. Mé [Mom] (from Correspondance pp. 129, 158.)"
"Poperinghe, 24 January 1915 (Near Dunkirk). Dear Irène, After various wanderings, we’ve arrived here, but we can’t make an attempt at working until we’ve made some modifications at the hospital. They want to build a shelter for the car and a partition to create the radiology room in a big ward. That all holds up the work, but it’s difficult to do otherwise. In Dunkirk, German planes dropped some bombs that killed a few people, but the populace is scarcely frightened. At Poperinghe too these accidents happen, but less often. We hear the guns grumbling almost constantly. It’s not raining, a bit of frost. We were welcomed at the hospital with extreme cordiality, I have a nice room and they give me a fire in a stove at the side. I’m better off than at Furnes, I’ll eat at the hospital. With a hug, Mé (from Correspondance pp. 129, 158.)"
"Prague, Sunday, 14 June 1925. Dear Irène, I got your letter of June 5 which arrived in Warsaw the 12th. I find that [delay] excessive... I arrived in Prague this morning and will leave tomorrow evening for Jachymow. I’m bewildered by the life I’m leading and incapable of telling you anything intelligent. I ask myself, what fundamental vice is there in the organization of humanity that makes this sort of agitation, to a certain degree, necessary? Mrs. Meloney [the American journalist who encouraged Marie to expose herself to the press] would call it, “Dignifying science.” And what’s undeniable is the sincerity of everyone who does these things and their conviction that they are necessary. Here I’m in a magnificent apartment, bedroom, sitting-room and bathroom, overlooking the river bordered by hills, and full of flowers they gave me at the train station—mostly roses since it’s their season. Unfortunately it’s gray, and I’m afraid it will rain.... With hugs, Mé (from Correspondance p. 255.)"
"Constantly held in suspicion and spied upon, the children knew that a single conversation in Polish, or an imprudent word, might seriously harm, not only themselves, but also their families.(Marie Curie)I easily learned mathematics and physics, as far as these sciences were taken in consideration in the school. I found in this ready help from my father, who loved science....Unhappily, he had no laboratory and could not perform experiments. (Marie Curie)"
"It was one of those groups of Polish youths who believed that the hope of their country lay in a great effort to develop the intellectual and moral strength of the nation....we agreed among ourselves to give evening courses, each one teaching what he knew best. (Marie Curie)"

"radium and polonium, coined the term “radio-active” and won the Nobel Prize—twice. But the Polish-born scientist, almost pathologically shy and accustomed to spending most of her time in her Paris laboratory, was stunned by the fanfare that greeted her., She attended a luncheon on her first day at the house of Mrs. Andrew Carnegie before receptions at the Waldorf Astoria and Carnegie Hall. She would later appear at the American Museum of Natural History, where an exhibit commemorated her discovery of radium. The American Chemical Society, the New York Mineralogical Club, cancer research facilities and the Bureau of Mines held events in her honor. Later that week, 2, 000 Smith College students sang Curie’s praises in a choral concert before bestowing her with an honorary degree. Dozens more colleges and universities, including Yale, Wellesley and the University of Chicago, conferred honors on her., The marquee event of her six-week U.S. tour was held in the East Room of the White House. President Warren Harding spoke at length, praising her “great attainments in the realms of science and intellect” and saying she represented the best in womanhood. “We lay at your feet the testimony of that love which all the generations of men have been wont to bestow upon the noble woman, the unselfish wife, the devoted mother.”, It was a rather odd thing to say to the most decorated scientist of that era, but then again Marie Curie was never easy to understand or categorize.

"testimony of that love which all the generations of men have been wont to bestow upon the noble woman, the unselfish wife, the devoted mother.”, It was a rather odd thing to say to the most decorated scientist of that era, but then again Marie Curie was never easy to understand or categorize. That was because she was a pioneer, an outlier, unique for the newness and immensity of her achievements. But it was also because of her sex. Curie worked during a great age of innovation, but proper women of her time were thought to be too sentimental to perform objective science. She would forever be considered a bit strange, not just a great scientist but a great, woman, scientist. You would not expect the president of the United States to praise one of Curie’s male contemporaries by calling attention to his manhood and his devotion as a father. Professional science until fairly recently was a man’s world, and in Curie’s time it was rare for a woman even to participate in academic physics, never mind triumph over it., This year marks the 100th anniversary of her second Nobel Prize, the first time anyone had achieved such a feat. In her honor, the United Nations named 2011 the International Year of Chemistry. Curie has always been a fascinating character, the subject of books and plays and movies, and this anniversary has prompted several new works about her.

"first time anyone had achieved such a feat. In her honor, the United Nations named 2011 the International Year of Chemistry. Curie has always been a fascinating character, the subject of books and plays and movies, and this anniversary has prompted several new works about her. October is Nobel Prize season, so it’s a good time to examine the story of her story—how she lived, but also how she has been mythologized and misunderstood., Curie was born Manya Sklodowska in November 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, and raised there during a Russian occupation. Her mother died of tuberculosis when Marie was 10 years old. A prodigy in both literature and math, as a teenager Marie attended a secret school called the “Floating University”—its locale changed regularly to avoid detection by the Russians—which taught physics and natural history as well as the forbidden subjects of Polish history and culture. Her father, a science teacher, encouraged his daughter’s curiosity but could not afford to send her to college. Marie worked as a governess until, at 24, she had saved enough money and purchased a train ticket to Paris, where she gravitated to the Latin Quarter and enrolled at the Sorbonne., She immersed herself in French and math and made ends meet cleaning glassware in university labs. She rationed her intake of food until, on more than one occasion, she collapsed of weakness.

"and enrolled at the Sorbonne., She immersed herself in French and math and made ends meet cleaning glassware in university labs. She rationed her intake of food until, on more than one occasion, she collapsed of weakness. Science thrilled her, and she earned a degree in physics in 1893 and another in mathematics the following year., In 1894, she met Pierre Curie, a 35-year-old physicist at a French technical college who had been studying crystals and magnetism. More than a decade before, he and his brother Jacques had discovered piezoelectricity, the electric charge produced in solid materials under pressure. Pierre was taken by Marie’s uncommon intellect and drive, and he proposed to her. “It would...be a beautiful thing, ” he wrote, “to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your dream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science.”, They were married in 1895 in a civil service attended by family and a few friends. For the occasion, Marie donned a blue cotton dress, one practical enough to wear in the laboratory after the ceremony. From then on, she and Pierre followed what they called an “anti-natural” path that included a “renunciation of the pleasures of life.” They lived plainly in their apartment on the rue de la Glacière within walking distance of their experiments. Pierre earned a modest 6, 000 francs per year, about $30, 000 today, while Marie worked gratis in his laboratory and prepared for an exam that would certify her to teach girls., The Curies’ first daughter, Irène,"
"that included a “renunciation of the pleasures of life.” They lived plainly in their apartment on the rue de la Glacière within walking distance of their experiments. Pierre earned a modest 6, 000 francs per year, about $30, 000 today, while Marie worked gratis in his laboratory and prepared for an exam that would certify her to teach girls., The Curies’ first daughter, Irène, was born in 1897. A difficult pregnancy had forced Marie to spend less time in the lab just as she was gathering data for a doctoral thesis. When her mother-in-law died weeks after Irène’s birth, her father-in-law, Eugene, a retired physician, stepped in, becoming the hands-on parent that others expected Marie to be., By the time her second daughter, Eve, was born in 1904, Marie had grown accustomed to the disdain of colleagues who thought she spent too much time in the lab and not enough in the nursery. Georges Sagnac, a friend and collaborator, eventually confronted her. “Don’t you love Irène?” he asked. “It seems to me that I wouldn’t prefer the idea of reading a paper by [Ernest] Rutherford, to getting what my body needs and looking after such an agreeable little girl.”, But read scientific publications she did. In labs across Europe, scientists were studying new and surprising phenomena. In 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen had discovered X-rays, and the mathematician Henri Poincaré sought to understand the luminescent rays that could pass through a hand and impress a ghostly image on photographic paper.

"looking after such an agreeable little girl.”, But read scientific publications she did. In labs across Europe, scientists were studying new and surprising phenomena. In 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen had discovered X-rays, and the mathematician Henri Poincaré sought to understand the luminescent rays that could pass through a hand and impress a ghostly image on photographic paper. Henri Becquerel was noting the emission of a different kind of mysterious rays, those from uranium salts. J. J. Thomson discovered negatively charged particles, which we now know as electrons (and which we now know are the source of X-rays)., Curie built on Becquerel’s observations of the element uranium. At first, she and other scientists were baffled about the source of the high-energy emissions. “The uranium shows no appreciable change of state, no visible chemical transformation, it remains, in appearance at least, the same as ever, the source of the energy it discharges remains undetectable, ” she wrote in 1900. She wondered whether the emitted rays were violating a basic law of thermodynamics: the conservation of energy., Finally, she posited a daring hypothesis: The rays emitted might be a basic property of uranium atoms, which we now know to be subatomic particles released as the atoms decay. Her theory had radical implications. Trish Baisden, a senior chemist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, describes it as a shocking proposal: “It was truly amazing and a bold statement at the time because the atom was thought to be the most elementary particle, one that could not be divided.

Trish Baisden, a senior chemist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, describes it as a shocking proposal: “It was truly amazing and a bold statement at the time because the atom was thought to be the most elementary particle, one that could not be divided. It further meant that atoms are not necessarily stable.” Curie’s hypothesis would revise the scientific understanding of matter at its most elemental level., Curie set out to measure the intensity of uranium’s rays by adapting the electrometer Pierre had invented with his brother. The device allowed her to measure extremely low electrical currents in air near mineral samples that contained uranium. She soon repeated the experiment with thorium, which behaved in similar ways., But she was puzzled by data that showed that the intensity of the radiation emitted by uranium and thorium was greater than expected based on the amounts of the elements she knew to be in her samples. “There must be, I thought, some unknown substance, very active, in these minerals, ” she concluded. “My husband agreed with me and I urged that we search at once for this hypothetical substance, thinking that, with joined efforts, a result would be quickly obtained.”, In 1898 she indeed identified one of the substances and named it polonium, after her homeland. Five months later, she identified a second element, which the world came to know as radium. Curie described the elements she studied as “radio-active.”, Pierre"
"and I urged that we search at once for this hypothetical substance, thinking that, with joined efforts, a result would be quickly obtained.”, In 1898 she indeed identified one of the substances and named it polonium, after her homeland. Five months later, she identified a second element, which the world came to know as radium. Curie described the elements she studied as “radio-active.”, Pierre put his crystals aside to help his wife isolate these radioactive elements and study their properties. Marie extracted pure radium salts from pitchblende, a highly radioactive ore obtained from mines in Bohemia. The extraction required tons of the substance, which she dissolved in cauldrons of acid before obtaining barium sulphate and other alkalines, which she then purified and converted into chlorides. The separation of radium from the alkalines required thousands of tedious crystallizations. But as she wrote to her brother in 1894, “one never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.” After four years, Curie had accumulated barely enough pure radium to fill a thimble., Working in a dilapidated shed with broken windows and poor ventilation, she nonetheless was able to make sensitive measurements. It is remarkable, says Baisden, that Curie calculated the atomic weight of radium so accurately given such deplorable conditions. “Large swings in temperature and humidity undoubtedly affected the electrometer...but Marie’s patience and tenacity prevailed.”, Both Curies were plagued by ailments—burns and fatigue—that, in retrospect, were clearly caused by repeated exposures to high doses of radiation.

It is remarkable, says Baisden, that Curie calculated the atomic weight of radium so accurately given such deplorable conditions. “Large swings in temperature and humidity undoubtedly affected the electrometer...but Marie’s patience and tenacity prevailed.”, Both Curies were plagued by ailments—burns and fatigue—that, in retrospect, were clearly caused by repeated exposures to high doses of radiation. Both, too, were resistant to the suggestion that their research materials caused their ailments., In 1903, Curie became the first woman in France to earn a PhD in physics. Professors who reviewed her doctoral thesis, which was about radiation, declared that it was the greatest single contribution to science ever written., Rumors of a Nobel Prize began to circulate, but some members of the French Academy of Sciences attributed the brilliance of the work not to Marie, but to her co-workers. These skeptics began to lobby quietly for the prize to be split between Becquerel and Pierre. But Pierre insisted to influential people on the Nobel committee that Marie had originated their research, conceived experiments and generated theories about the nature of radioactivity., Both Curies shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel in 1903. It was the first Nobel to be awarded to a woman., At the awards ceremony, the president of the Swedish Academy, which administered the prize, quoted the Bible in his remarks about the Curies’ research: “It is not good that man should be alone, I will make a helpmeet for him.”, Whether Marie Curie took the remark as an insult is not known—it"
"1903. It was the first Nobel to be awarded to a woman., At the awards ceremony, the president of the Swedish Academy, which administered the prize, quoted the Bible in his remarks about the Curies’ research: “It is not good that man should be alone, I will make a helpmeet for him.”, Whether Marie Curie took the remark as an insult is not known—it surely rankles today—but it must be among the most grudging comments ever said to a laureate. Moreover, the notion that Marie was a mere helpmeet to Pierre—one of the more persistent myths about her—was an opinion widely held, judging from published and unpublished comments by other scientists and observers., “Errors are notoriously hard to kill, ” observed her friend, the British physicist Hertha Ayrton, “but an error that ascribes to a man what was actually the work of a woman has more lives than a cat.”, At the Sorbonne, it was Pierre who got the plum job, a full professorship. Marie was not promoted. Pierre hired more assistants and made Marie the official head of the laboratory, freeing her to conduct experiments and for the first time, be paid for it., The most successful collaboration between a husband and wife in the history of science ended suddenly on April 19, 1906, when Pierre, apparently lost in thought, walked into traffic on the rue Dauphine and was killed instantly by an onrushing carriage., Instead of accepting a widow’s pension, Marie took over Pierre’s position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to teach"
"paid for it., The most successful collaboration between a husband and wife in the history of science ended suddenly on April 19, 1906, when Pierre, apparently lost in thought, walked into traffic on the rue Dauphine and was killed instantly by an onrushing carriage., Instead of accepting a widow’s pension, Marie took over Pierre’s position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to teach there. Hundreds of people—students, artists, photographers, celebrities—lined up outside the university on November 5, 1906, hoping to attend her first lecture. She gave no outward sign of mourning. She began by summarizing the recent breakthroughs in physics research. “When one considers the progress of physics in the last decade, ” she said, “one is surprised by the changes it has produced in our ideas about electricity and about matter.”, She wrote a diary during this time, addressed to her late husband, about continuing their research. “I am working in the laboratory all day long, it is all I can do: I am better off there than anywhere else, ” she wrote. In 1910, she published a 971-page treatise on radioactivity. Some men in the scientific establishment still didn’t consider her an equal, however; she applied for membership in the French Academy of Sciences in 1910, and although Pierre had been a member, she was denied by two votes. One Academy member, the physicist Emile Amagat, claimed that “women cannot be part of the Institute of France.”, In 1911, rumors spread that Curie was having an affair with the prominent physicist Paul Langevin,"
"consider her an equal, however; she applied for membership in the French Academy of Sciences in 1910, and although Pierre had been a member, she was denied by two votes. One Academy member, the physicist Emile Amagat, claimed that “women cannot be part of the Institute of France.”, In 1911, rumors spread that Curie was having an affair with the prominent physicist Paul Langevin, a man five years her junior who had been Pierre’s student and had worked closely with Albert Einstein. Langevin’s estranged wife discovered apparent love letters from Curie to her husband and gave them to a tabloid newspaper. It and other publications ran stories with headlines such as “A Romance in a Laboratory.” Although a widower under similar circumstances would likely not have suffered any consequences, Curie found her reputation tarnished. Neither Curie nor Langevin discussed their relationship with outsiders. “I believe there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life, ” she wrote to a critic., The front-page coverage of the scandal threatened to overshadow another news story later that year: her second Nobel Prize., This one, in chemistry, was for the discovery of polonium and radium. In her acceptance speech in Stockholm, she paid tribute to her husband but also made clear that her work was independent from his, spelling out their separate contributions and describing the discoveries she had made after his death., At the end of 1911, Curie became very ill.

"of polonium and radium. In her acceptance speech in Stockholm, she paid tribute to her husband but also made clear that her work was independent from his, spelling out their separate contributions and describing the discoveries she had made after his death., At the end of 1911, Curie became very ill. She had an operation to remove lesions from her uterus and kidney, followed by a long recovery. In 1913, she began to travel again and return to science. In March of that year, Einstein paid her an extended visit, and later she opened and headed a new research facility in Warsaw. As she was setting up a second institute, in Paris, World War I broke out. She outfitted 18 portable X-ray stations that could treat wounded soldiers on the front lines. She sometimes operated and repaired the machines herself, and established 200 more permanent X-ray posts during the war., Eve became a journalist and wrote the definitive biography, Madame Curie, published in 1937. Irène studied at her mother’s institute in Paris and married her mother’s assistant, the charismatic physicist Frédéric Joliot, with whom she bore two children. Irène maintained a strong presence in the lab, and in 1935, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie were awarded a Nobel Prize for synthesizing new radioactive elements. It was another record: the first time both a parent and child had separately won the Nobel Prize., After Marie Curie’s second Nobel Prize and her subsequent research, she was rarely dismissed as a helpmeet.

"presence in the lab, and in 1935, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie were awarded a Nobel Prize for synthesizing new radioactive elements. It was another record: the first time both a parent and child had separately won the Nobel Prize., After Marie Curie’s second Nobel Prize and her subsequent research, she was rarely dismissed as a helpmeet. And once the tabloids moved on from the Langevin scandal, her image as a homewrecker faded. But there were deliberate efforts to shape her story. A case in point was Curie’s first trip to America, in 1921., The tour was largely the work of a New York City journalist named Missy Meloney, who had interviewed Curie in 1920 in Paris for the women’s magazine the, Delineator, which Meloney edited. Meloney learned that the Curies had never patented the process for purifying radium. As a result, other scientists and U.S. chemical companies were processing radium, then selling it for cancer treatments and military research for $100, 000 per gram. Curie was now unable to afford the element she had discovered. Sensing a human-interest story, Meloney created the Marie Curie Radium Fund to raise money to purchase radium for Curie’s continuing research., American women would be inspired to give to Curie, Meloney figured, only if her image as a scientist—which stereotypically suggested someone dispassionate, even severe—could be softened. So Meloney’s articles presented Curie as a benevolent healer, intent on using radium to treat cancer. Meloney also persuaded editor friends at other newspapers and magazines to emphasize the same image. Curie understood that"
"for Curie’s continuing research., American women would be inspired to give to Curie, Meloney figured, only if her image as a scientist—which stereotypically suggested someone dispassionate, even severe—could be softened. So Meloney’s articles presented Curie as a benevolent healer, intent on using radium to treat cancer. Meloney also persuaded editor friends at other newspapers and magazines to emphasize the same image. Curie understood that radium might be useful in the clinic, but she had no direct role in using it for medical treatments. Nevertheless, Curie’s motivation for discovering radium, according to a headline in the, Delineator, was “That Millions Shall Not Die.” Writers described her as the “Jeanne D’Arc of the laboratory, ” with a face of “suffering and patience.”, Curie disapproved of the publicity campaign. In lectures, she reminded her audience that her discovery of radium was the work “of pure science...done for itself” rather than with “direct usefulness” in mind., And yet Meloney’s efforts succeeded: She raised more than $100, 000 on Curie’s behalf within months, enough to buy a gram of radium for the Curie Institute in Paris. Meloney invited Curie to the United States., Curie, who disliked travel and attention, agreed to come to thank Meloney and those who had contributed to the cause. But, she wrote Meloney, “you know how careful I am to avoid all publicity referring to my name. And how I should be very grateful to arrange for my voyage with the minimum of publicity.”, Curie sailed with Irène, 23, and Eve, 16, and within hours of disembarking"
"and attention, agreed to come to thank Meloney and those who had contributed to the cause. But, she wrote Meloney, “you know how careful I am to avoid all publicity referring to my name. And how I should be very grateful to arrange for my voyage with the minimum of publicity.”, Curie sailed with Irène, 23, and Eve, 16, and within hours of disembarking in New York embarked on a whirlwind tour that took her as far west as the Grand Canyon. As it wore on, Curie became exhausted and asked to cancel events, or at least not have to speak at them. She appeared aloof and sometimes refused to shake hands with admirers. She did not appear to be the kindly maternal figure that Meloney had made her out to be. Clearly, Curie’s strength and patience were wearing thin., She carried the gram of radium home to Paris in a vial handed to her by President Harding at the White House. She worked in her laboratory until her death., When Curie died, at age 66 in 1934, journalists echoed the image popularized by Meloney. The, New York Times, called her a “martyr to science” who “contributed more to the general welfare of mankind” as a “modest, self-effacing woman.” The physicist Robert Millikan, president of the California Institute of Technology, issued a public statement: “In spite of her continuous absorption in her scientific work, she has devoted much time to the cause of peace....She embodied in her person all the simpler, homelier and yet most perfect"
"“martyr to science” who “contributed more to the general welfare of mankind” as a “modest, self-effacing woman.” The physicist Robert Millikan, president of the California Institute of Technology, issued a public statement: “In spite of her continuous absorption in her scientific work, she has devoted much time to the cause of peace....She embodied in her person all the simpler, homelier and yet most perfect virtues of womanhood.”, In the years after her death, scientists, historians, artists and others have grappled with her story, often highlighting qualities or imputing traits to her that reflected contemporary social values more than biographical truths. Curie’s portrayal in books and movies tended to emphasize her roles as wife, mother and humanitarian at the expense of her importance as a brilliant physicist. Most memorably, MGM’s, Madame Curie, (1943) featured Greer Garson as a devoted wife rather than a sometimes prickly, independent scientist., With the women’s movement of the 1960s and ’70s, Curie’s reputation as a remarkable scientist came to the fore. The physicist Rosalyn Yalow, in an essay she wrote at the time of winning her own Nobel Prize in 1977 for research involving radioactive compounds, said that Curie was her inspiration. Biographers attempted to depict the brilliance and complexity of this outsize character. A new play, Radiance, written by the actor and director Alan Alda, focuses on her relationships with Pierre and Langevin as well as her science.

Mental Toughness embraces what is commonly known as Resilience and adds the Optimism components of Challenge and Confidence to create a more complete model., Born Maria Sklodowska, more than 150 years ago, on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, Marie Curie achieved iconic status as a remarkable scientist who developed what we now understand as “radioactivity”. She became the first person to achieve a Nobel Prize in two different disciplines for work that has transformed everyone’s lives forevermore. From very humble origins with little financial support and resources, Marie, and her husband Pierre, isolated and identified Polonium and Radium when most of the scientific community didn’t believe in their existence., Her deep sense of purpose and value that drove her work ethic was working for the common good. For instance, Marie developed the first ambulances with x-ray capability in WW1., Whilst today Marie Curie is celebrated as one of"
"support and resources, Marie, and her husband Pierre, isolated and identified Polonium and Radium when most of the scientific community didn’t believe in their existence., Her deep sense of purpose and value that drove her work ethic was working for the common good. For instance, Marie developed the first ambulances with x-ray capability in WW1., Whilst today Marie Curie is celebrated as one of the world’s highest achievers in Science, it is even more significant in light of the systemic norms of the day where not only were women not expected to work as scientists and raise a family, but would commonly be held back from doing so., When invited to speak on their work at the Royal Institution in London, only Pierre was allowed to speak. When the Nobel Prize committee awarded the first Nobel Prize in 1903, they initially awarded it only to her husband. The Committee eventually relented and Marie became the first woman to receive a Nobel prize. Quite rightly Marie Curie was role-modelling what would become feminist ideals and she was changing the world through her beliefs and actions., When we look at the Control elements of Mental Toughness, Marie demonstrated the sense of “can do” belief in self and her ideas despite widespread opposition in the scientific community. Renowned for her Emotional Control, Einstein remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame., Curie herself said, “Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that?

"Mental Toughness, Marie demonstrated the sense of “can do” belief in self and her ideas despite widespread opposition in the scientific community. Renowned for her Emotional Control, Einstein remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame., Curie herself said, “Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance.”, When we consider Commitment, this is where Curie excelled. Her attitude is succinctly embodied in another of her quotes “I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done.”, She clearly had a goal and a belief in her ability to achieve it. Importantly, she did whatever necessary to achieve that goal. The work was heavy and physically demanding – and involved danger. Pierre and Marie Curie carried out all of the work themselves processing tons of raw pitchblende – a highly radioactive material. Working very long hours, they didn’t have a laboratory assistant until 3 years after winning the first Nobel Prize!, Of course, when we consider Challenge, as a genuine pioneer in her field, facing significant opposition on numerous fronts, she was clearly open to new ideas and to taking risks – and learning from their consequences, good or bad. Marie Curie is famously quoted as saying “First principle: never to let one’s self be beaten down by persons or by events” and “Nothing in this world is to be feared… only understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less”. This"
"open to new ideas and to taking risks – and learning from their consequences, good or bad. Marie Curie is famously quoted as saying “First principle: never to let one’s self be beaten down by persons or by events” and “Nothing in this world is to be feared… only understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less”. This attitude is a wonderful clear expression of the importance of being open to learning., Curie’s work ethic, mindset and choices were underpinned by her Confidence in her own Abilities. She was a competent and talented scholar as evidenced by achieving the highest grades at school before entering University in Paris at 15 years of age. Being determined not to fall into teaching or becoming a governess as the only occupations available for professional women at that time, Curie pursued Physics and Mathematical Sciences. She clearly valued challenging the status quo and committing her personal efforts to find solutions when she stated “Life is not easy for any of us. We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained”., Her Interpersonal Confidence was also a clear strength. She mixed freely with her contemporaries and earned their respect – again when it was unknown for women to offer and express ideas that challenged the beliefs and norms of the day. She was also a prolific writer., As in all case studies, Marie Curie wasn’t perfect and just"
"and that this thing must be attained”., Her Interpersonal Confidence was also a clear strength. She mixed freely with her contemporaries and earned their respect – again when it was unknown for women to offer and express ideas that challenged the beliefs and norms of the day. She was also a prolific writer., As in all case studies, Marie Curie wasn’t perfect and just like any other human being she had her faults. Her single-mindedness led her to take risks. She eventually died from exposure to radiation. To this day her books and notes are locked in a lead case – being highly radioactive., She seemed to be incredibly self-aware and very reflective. These traits enabled her to develop a reputation for honesty and generosity. She gave away most of the money she received from the Nobel Prizes and insisted that any prizes be given to good causes., Nevertheless, her Mental Toughness enabled her to achieve more significant outcomes during her research career than any of her peers. If Marie Curie was a man, these achievements would still be remarkable because the world of science and innovation was and still is very much a man’s world. As a woman, Curie had a harder path to tread but dealt with all of the biases, barriers and injustices with remarkable poise., She was not averse to making impactful political gestures either. In her time Poland didn’t exist, being part of three Empires. She named her first discovery Polonium in support of her dream of a free Polish state.,"
"much a man’s world. As a woman, Curie had a harder path to tread but dealt with all of the biases, barriers and injustices with remarkable poise., She was not averse to making impactful political gestures either. In her time Poland didn’t exist, being part of three Empires. She named her first discovery Polonium in support of her dream of a free Polish state., Our colleague Prof Peter Clough often uses a phrase to describe what Mental Toughness brings to an individual. He describes it as “being comfortable in your own skin and dealing with what life throws at you and the opportunities that arise”. There may be no better example of this than Marie Curie., Mental Toughness describes the mindset that every person adopts in everything they do. It is closely related to qualities such as character, resilience, grit, etc. Mental Toughness is defined as a personality trait which determines in large part how people deal with challenge, stressors and pressure …. irrespective of prevailing circumstances., Finally, again I need to own up. My mother, a Pole, perhaps for reasons now very obvious, idolised Marie Curie. I paid little attention to that until recently. Belatedly, researching this article became a pleasure and I found it more than a little inspirational., During the course of that research, I came across another fascinating quote “The older one gets, the more one feels that the present must be enjoyed; it is a precious gift, comparable to a state of grace”.

But, though scientifically less fruitful, her later years were in many ways the most eventful of her life., In, Marie Curie and Her Daughters, Shelley Emling focuses on this later era in the great scientist’s life. It included a controversial love affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a friendship with Albert Einstein, the establishment of the Radium Institute in Paris, her pioneering use of radiography on the French wounded in the first world war, her tours of the United States to raise money to obtain radium for her institutes in Paris and Warsaw, and her relationships with her daughters, scientist Irène Joliot-Curie and writer Eve Curie.,"
"affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a friendship with Albert Einstein, the establishment of the Radium Institute in Paris, her pioneering use of radiography on the French wounded in the first world war, her tours of the United States to raise money to obtain radium for her institutes in Paris and Warsaw, and her relationships with her daughters, scientist Irène Joliot-Curie and writer Eve Curie., Science is not the strength of this book. Pierre Curie’s vital contribution and personality are rendered almost invisible, and Emling says little about the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and the Curies in the 1890s – and botches the references she does make to the Curies’ legendary preparation of radium between 1899 and 1902., Advertisement, Still, the book works well at a more personal level and inspires fresh admiration for Marie Curie’s dedication to science, ethics and individuals, particularly her two daughters. After working closely with her mother, Irène went on to win a Nobel prize for her work on artificial radioactivity in 1935, in collaboration with her own husband. Eve wrote a biography of her mother, Madame Curie, which was a worldwide bestseller in the 1930s and was adapted to make a Hollywood feature film in 1943., Perhaps the most surprising part of the book, though, is to see how Curie’s welcome in the US in 1921 – by universities, companies and public figures including US president Warren Harding – enabled her to shake off her dread of the spotlight.

"and was adapted to make a Hollywood feature film in 1943., Perhaps the most surprising part of the book, though, is to see how Curie’s welcome in the US in 1921 – by universities, companies and public figures including US president Warren Harding – enabled her to shake off her dread of the spotlight. Wisely or not, Marie and Pierre always refused on principle to patent any of their techniques, and so their radium institutes were long deprived of resources. By her 1929 US tour, she used her fame to help raise funds for her institutes’ research., Yet as this latest biography makes clear, it never went to her head.
