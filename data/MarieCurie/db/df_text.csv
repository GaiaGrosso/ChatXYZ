Marie Salomea Skłodowska Curie (/ ˈkj ʊ əri/ KURE-ee;[3]
French: [ky ʁ i]; Polish: [k ʲi ˈri], born Maria Salomea Skłodowska
Polish: [ ˈmarja sal ɔ ˈ m ɛ a skw ɔ ˈ d ɔ fska]; 7 November 1867 – 4 July
1934)  was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist
who conduc ted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the
first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only
woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win
the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie,
was a co-winner on her first Nobel Prize, making them the first
ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the
Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the
first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[4]
She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom  of
Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's
clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific
training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister
Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees
and condu cted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married
the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel
Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel
for their pioneering work developing the theory of
""radioactivity""—a term she coined.[5][6] In 1906 Pierre Curie died
in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium,
using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.
Under her direction, the world's first studies were conduc ted into
the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. In
1920 she founde d the Curie Institute in Paris, and in 1932 the
Curie Institute in Warsaw; both remain major centres of medical
research. During World War I she developed mobile radiography
units to provide X-ray services to field hos pitals.
While a French citizen, Marie Skłodow ska Curie, who used both
surnames,[7][8] never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught
her daughters the Polish langua ge and took them on visits to
Poland.[9] She named the first chemical element she discovered
polonium, after her native country.[a]
Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at the Sancellemoz sanatorium
in Passy (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia from exposure
to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the
course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War
I.[11] In addition to her Nobel Prizes, she has received numerous
other hono urs and tributes; in 1995 she became the first woman toDiscovering polonium

Maria Skłodow ska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the
Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and younge st
child of well-know n teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and
Władysław Skłodow ski.[13] The elder siblings of Maria
(nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia),
Józef (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born 1865,
nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed
Hela).[14][15]
On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their
property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish
national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the
most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863–65) .[16] This

Maria (left), sister
Bronisława, c. 1886elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.[16] Maria's
paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodow ski, had been principal of the
Lublin primary school attended by Bolesław Prus,[17] who be came
a leading figure in Polish literature.[18]
Władysław Skłodow ski taught mathematics and phys ics, subjects
that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw
gymnasia (seconda ry schools) for boys. After Russian authorities
eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he
brought  much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed his
children in its use.[14] He was eventually fired by his Russian
supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take lower-
paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and
eventually chose to
supplement their income by
lodging boys in the
house.[14] Maria's mother
Bronisława operated a
prestigious Warsaw boarding
school for girls; she resigned
from the position after Maria
was born.[14] She died of
tuberculosis in May 1878,
when Maria was ten years
old.[14] Less than three years
earlier, Maria's oldest sibling,
Zofia, had died of typhus  contracted from a boarder.[14] Maria's father was
an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic.[19] The deaths of Maria's mother
and sister caused her to give up C atholicism and be come agnostic.[20]
When she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of
J. Sikorska; next, she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she
graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal.[13] After a collapse,
possibly due to depression,[14] she spent the following year in the
countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in
Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.[13] Unable to enroll in a regular
institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister
Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University
(sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution
of higher learning that admitted women students.[13][14]
Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give
her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in
exchange for similar assistance two years later.[13][21] In conne ction with
this, Maria took a position as gove rness: first as a home tutor in Warsaw;
then for two years as a gove rness in Szczuki with a landed family, the
Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father.[13][21] While working for the
latter family, she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician.[21] His
parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppos e
them.[21] Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon e arned a doctorate and
pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University.Krakowskie Przedmiescie
66, Warsaw, where Maria
did her first scientific work,
1890–91.Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw
Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria
Skłodow ska that had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute,
which she had founde d in 1932.[16][22]
At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława—who a few months earlier had
married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political
activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she
could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half
longe r to gather the necessary funds.[13] She was helped by her father, who
was able to secure a more lucrative position again.[21] All that time she
continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being
tutored herself.[21] In early 1889 she returned home to her father in
Warsaw.[13] She continued working as a gove rness and remained there till
late 1891.[21] She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her
practical scientific training (1890–91)  in a chemical laboratory at the
Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near
Warsaw's Old Town.[13][14][21] The laboratory was run by he r cousin Józef
Bogus ki, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian
chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.[13][21][23]
In late 1891, she left Poland for France.[24] In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be know n in France)
briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the
Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of
Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891.[25][26] She subsisted on her meagre resources, keeping herself warm
during cold winters by wearing all the clothes she had. She focused so hard on her studies that she
sometimes forgot to eat.[26] Skłodow ska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her
keep. In 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an indus trial laboratory of Gabriel
Lippmann. Meanwhile, she continued studying at the University of Paris and with the aid of a fellowship
she was able to earn a second de gree in 1894.[13][26][b]
Skłodow ska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of
various steels, commissioned by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry.[26] That same
year, Pierre Curie entered her life: it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them
together.[27] Pierre Curie was an instructor at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher
Educational Institution (ESPCI Paris).[13] They were introduc ed by Polish physicist Józef Wierusz-
Kowalski, who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-
Kowalski thought  Pierre could access.[13][26] Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to
find some space for Skłodow ska where she was able to begin work.[26]
Their mutual passion for science brough t them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings for
one another.[13][26] Eventually, Pierre proposed marriage, but at first Skłodow ska did not accept as she was
still planning to go back to her native country. Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her
to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French.[13] Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break,
Skłodow ska returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family.[26] She was still labouring unde r the illusion
that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at Kraków
University because of sexism in academia.[16] A letter from Pierre convinced her to return to Paris toLife in ParisPierre and Marie Curie in the
laboratory, c. 1904pursue a Ph.D.[26] At Skłodowska's insistence, Curie had written up his research on magnetism and
received his own doctorate in March 1895;  he was also promoted to professor at the School.[26] A
contemporary qui p would call Skłodow ska ""Pierre's biggest discovery"".[16]
On 26 July 1895, they were married in Sceaux;[28] neither wanted a religious service.[13][26] Curie's dark
blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit.[26] They
shared two pastimes: long bicycle trips and journeys abroad, which brought  them even closer. In Pierre,
Marie had found a  new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on w hom she could depend.[16]
In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the existence of X-rays,
though the mechanism behind their produc tion was not yet
unde rstood.[29] In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium
salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating
power.[29] He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike
phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy
but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced
by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into
uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.[13][29]
She used an innova tive technique to investigate samples. Fifteen
years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version
of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric
charge.[29] Using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a
sample to conduc t electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the
uranium compounds  depended only on the quantity of uranium present.[29] She hypot hesized that the
radiation w as not the outcome of some interaction of  molecules but must come from the atom itself.[29] This
hypot hesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.[29][30]
In 1897, her daughter Irène was born. To suppor t her family, Curie began teaching at the École Normale
Supérieure.[24] The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a
conve rted shed next to ESPCI.[24] The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly
ventilated and not even waterproof.[31] They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation expos ure
attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. ESPCI did not sponsor her
research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various
organizations and gove rnments.[24][31][32]
Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also know n as
chalcolite).[31] Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and
chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its
activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was
far more active than uranium.[31][33] She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit
radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive.[29] Pierre Curie was
increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work
on crystals and to join her.[24][31]
The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own; no one helped her formulate it, and although
she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it. She later
recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chanceNew elementsPierre, Irène, & Marie Curie, c. 1902whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she]
realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable
of the original work in which she was involved.[34]
She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing
her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not
Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the
Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the
discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead
have gone  to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid
means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account
of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April
1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann.[35] Even so, just
as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten
in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the
same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt
had publ ished his own finding in Berlin.[36]
At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her
paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself:
""The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is
much more active than uranium."" She later would recall how she felt ""a passionate desire to verify this
hypot hesis as rapidly as possible.""[36] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram
sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they
were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonne s
of the ore.[36]
In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announc ing the existence of an element they
named ""polonium"", in hono ur of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain
partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian).[13] On 26 December 1898, the Curies
announc ed the existence of a second element, which they named ""radium"", from the Latin word for
""ray"".[24][31][37] In the course of their research, they also coined the word ""radioactivity"".[13]
To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt , the Curies sought  to isolate polonium and radium in pure
form.[31] Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous  task.
The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and
polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.[31] Radium, however, was more elusive; it is
closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had
obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond
reach.[38] The Curies unde rtook t he arduous  task of separating out  radium salt by di fferential crystallization.
From a tonne  of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she
isolated pure radium metal.[31][39] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only
138 da ys.[31]
Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers,
including one  that announc ed that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed
faster than healthy cells.[40]
In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure and her husband
joined the faculty of the University of Paris.[41][42] In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her
father's death.[24]Pierre and Marie Curie, c. 1903
1903 Nobel Prize portrait
1903 Nobel Prize diplomaIn June 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was
awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris.[24][43] That
month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London t o
give a speech on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented
from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to.[44]
Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, ba sed on r adium.[41]
The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from
this increasingly profitable business.[31][41]
In December 1903 the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences
awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie,
and Henri Becquerel the Nobel
Prize in Physics, ""in recognition of
the extraordinary services they have
rendered by their joint researches on the
radiation phenomena discovered by
Professor Henri Becquerel.""[24] At first the
committee had intended to honour  only
Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a
committee member and advoc ate for
women scientists, Swedish mathematician
Magnus Gösta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre
to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the
nomination.[45] Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.[24]
Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with
their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.[44][45] As Nobel
laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally unde rtook the trip in 1905.[45] The award
money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.[45] Following the award of the Nobel Prize,
and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the
University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have
a proper laboratory.[24][41][42] Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to
furnish a new laboratory, but it would not  be ready unt il 1906.[45]
In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, Ève.[45] She hired Polish governesses to
teach her daughters her native langua ge, and sent or took t hem on vi sits to Poland.[9]
On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy
rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him
instantly.[24][46] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.[47] On 13 May 1906 the physics department
of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it
to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband
Pierre.[47][48] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[24]
Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later
years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a
radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.[48] The initiative
for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the PasteurNobel PrizesAt the first Solvay Conference

1911 Nobel Prize diplomaInstitute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory
and had sugge sted that she move to the Pasteur Institute.[24][49] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving,
did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the
University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.[49]
In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an
international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually
named for her and Pierre: the curie.[48] Nevertheless, in 1911 the
French Academy of Sciences failed, by one[24] or two votes,[50] to
elect her to membership in the Academy. Elected instead was
Édoua rd Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi
develop the wireless telegraph.[51] It was only over half a century
later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey,
became the first woman elected to membership in the Academy.
Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's
attitude tended toward xenophobi a—the same that had led to the
Dreyfus affair—which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was
Jewish.[24][50] During the French Academy of Sciences elections,
she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and
atheist.[50] Her daughter later remarked on the French press's
hypoc risy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she
was nominated for a French honour , but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign
honour s such as her Nobel Prizes.[24]
In 191 1 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long a ffair with phys icist Paul Langevin, a former
student of Pierre Curie's,[52] a married man who was estranged from his wife.[50] This resulted in a press
scandal that was exploited by her academic oppone nts. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older
than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.[53] When the
scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of
her hous e and ha d to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the hom e of her friend, Camille Marbo.[50]
International recognition for her work had been growing to new
heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming
oppos ition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honour ed her a
second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[16] This
award was ""in recognition of her services to the advancement of
chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium,
by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and
compounds  of this remarkable element.""[54] Because of the
negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the
Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her
attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in
Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing. Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony,
because “the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium” and that “there is no
relation be tween her scientific work and the facts of her private life”.
She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel
laureates in two fields each. A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by nove list Henryk
Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.[16] Curie's
second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French gove rnment to suppor t the Radium Institute, built in
1914, where research was conduc ted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.[49] A month after accepting herCurie in a mobile X-ray vehicle,
c. 19151911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912, she
avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton. She
returned to her laboratory onl y in December, after a break of about 14 m onths.[54]
In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she
declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street
named Rue Pierre-Curie.[49][54] She was appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium
Institute of the University of Paris, founde d in 1914.[55] She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in
Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The institute's development was
interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed
its activities in 1919.[49][54][56]
During World War I, Curie recognised that wounde d soldiers were
best served if operated upon as soon as possible.[57] She saw a
need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist
battlefield surgeons,[56] including to obviate amputations when in
fact limbs could be saved.[58][59] After a quick study of radiology,
anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray
equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile
radiography units, which came to be popul arly know n as petites
Curies (""Little Curies"").[56] She became the director of the Red
Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology
centre, operational by late 1914.[56] Assisted at first by a military
doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles
and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.[49][56] Later, she began
training ot her women as aides.[60]
In 1915, Curie produc ed hollow needles containing ""radium emanation"", a colourless, radioactive gas
given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the
radium from her own one-gram supply.[60] It is estimated that over a million wound ed soldiers were treated
with her X-ray units.[20][49] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that
period.[49] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any
formal recognition of  it from the French gove rnment.[56]
Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to dona te her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort
but the French National Bank refused to accept them.[60] She did buy war bonds , using her Nobel Prize
money.[60] She said:
I am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are
quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my
second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what
we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it.
Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.[57]
She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause.[61] After
the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919) .[60]World War IMarie and daughter Irène,
1925In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French gove rnment established a stipend
for her; its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur (1822–95) .[49] In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly
when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium. Mrs. William Brown Meloney,
after interviewing Curie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising
her trip.[49][62][c]
In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram
of radium collected in the United States, and the First Lady praised her as an example of a professional
achiever who was also a suppor tive wife.[4][64] Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad,
and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French
gove rnment offered her a Legion of  Honour  award, but she refused.[64][65] In 1922 she became a fellow of
the French Academy of Medicine.[49] She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving
lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and C zechoslovakia.[66]
Led by Curie, the Institute produc ed four more Nobel Prize winners,
including her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Frédéric
Joliot-Curie.[67] Eventually it became one of the world's four major
radioactivity-research laboratories, the others being the Cavendish
Laboratory, with Ernest Rutherford; the Institute for Radium Research,
Vienna, with Stefan Meyer; and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry,
with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner.[67][68]
In Augus t 1922 Marie Curie became a member of the League of Nations'
newly created International Committee on Intellectual Coope ration.[69][12]
She sat on the committee until 1934 and contributed to League of Nations'
scientific coordination with other prominent researchers such as Albert
Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz, and Henri Bergson.[70] In 1923 she wrote a
biography of her late husband, titled Pierre Curie.[71] In 1925 she visited
Poland to participate in a ceremony laying the founda tions for Warsaw's
Radium Institute.[49] Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium
Institute with radium; the Institute opened in 1932, with her sister Bronisława its director.[49][64] These
distractions from her scientific labours, and the attendant publicity, caused her much discomfort but
provided resources for her work.[64] In 1930 she was elected to the International Atomic Weights
Committee, on which she served until her death.[72] In 1931, Curie was awarded the Cameron Prize for
Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.[73]
Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934.[16][74] A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died
aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been
contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, c ausing da mage to her bone  marrow.[49][75]
The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not know n at the time of her work, which had been carried
out without the safety measures later developed.[74] She had carried test tubes containing radioactive
isotopes in her pocket,[76] and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the
substances gave off in the dark.[77] Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while
serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war.[60] In fact, when Curie's body was exhum ed in
1995, t he French Office de Protection contre les Rayonne ments Ionisants (ORPI) ""concluded that she couldPostwar years
Death1935 statue, facing the

They pointed out that radium poses a risk only if it is ingested,[78] and
speculated that her illness was more likely to have been due to her use of
radiography dur ing the First World War.[79]
She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband
Pierre.[49] Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour  of their achievements, the
remains of both were transferred to the Paris Panthéon. Their remains were
sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity.[80] She became the
second woman to be interred at the Panthéon (after Sophie Berthelot) and
the first woman to be honour ed with interment in the Panthéon on her own
merits.[12]
Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the
1890s  are considered too dangerous to handle.[81] Even her cookbooks  are
highly radioactive.[82] Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxe s, and those
who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.[82] In her last year, she worked on a book,
Radioactivity, which was publ ished pos thumously in 1935.[74]
The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to
shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.[83] Cornell
University professor L. Pearce Williams observes:
The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's
radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It
seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of
energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the
founda tions of physics. On the experimental level the
discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with
sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the
structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments
with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In
medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a
means by w hich cancer could be successfully attacked.[39]
If Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound
effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her
native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This aspect of her
life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Curie's role as a
feminist precursor.[16]
She was know n for her hone sty and m oderate lifestyle.[24][83] Having received a small scholarship in 1893,
she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep.[13][32] She gave much of her first Nobel
Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates.[16] In an unusual decision, Curie
intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific community could do
research unhindered.[84] She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutionsLegacyTomb of Pierre and Marie

Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by
fame.[16]
As one of the most famous scientists, Marie Curie has become an icon in
the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in
the realm of pop c ulture.[85]
In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in
the Panthéon, P aris.[12]
In a 2009  poll carried out by New Scientist, she was voted the ""most
inspirational woman in science"". Curie received 25.1 percent of all votes
cast, nearly twice as many as second-place Rosalind Franklin (14.2 per
cent).[86][87]
On the centenary of her second N obel Prize, Poland de clared 201 1 the Year
of Marie Curie;[88] and the United Nations declared that this would be the
International Year of Chemistry.[89] An artistic installation celebrating
""Madame Curie"" filled the Jacobs Gallery at San Diego's Museum of
Contemporary Art.[90] On 7 November, Google celebrated the anniversary
of her birth with a special Google Doodle.[91] On 10 December, the New
York Academy of Sciences celebrated the centenary of Marie Curie's
second Nobel Prize in the presence of Princess Madeleine of Sweden.[92]
Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to
win two Nobel Prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only
person to win in multiple sciences.[93] Awards that she received include:
Nobel Prize in Physics (1903, with her husband Pierre Curie
and Henri Becquerel)[24]
Davy Medal (1903, with Pierre)[66][94]
Matteucci Medal (1904, with Pierre)[94]
Actonian Prize (1907)[95]
Elliott Cresson Medal (1909)[96]
Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1911)[16]
Franklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society (1921)[97]
She received numerous honor ary degrees from universities across the world.[64] In Poland, she received
honor ary doctorates from the Lwów Polytechnic (1912) ,[98] Poznań University (1922) , Kraków's
Jagiellonian University (1924) , and the Warsaw Polytechnic (1926) .[89] In 1920 s he became the first female
member of The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.[99] In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded
membership in the Iota Sigma Pi women scientists' society.[100] In 1924, she became an Honorary Member
of the Polish Chemical Society.[101] Marie Curie's 1898 publ ication w ith her husband and their collaborator
Gustave Bémont[102] of their discovery of radium and polonium was honour ed by a Citation for Chemical
Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society
presented to the ESPCI Paris in 2015.[103][104]Honours and tributesEntities that have been named in her honour  include:
The curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie
(although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the
standard was named after Pierre, Marie, or both).[105]
The element with atomic number 96 was named curium.[106]
Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and
cuprosklodowskite.[107]
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young
scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her.[108]
In 2007, a metro station in Paris was renamed to honour both of the Curies.[107]
Polish nuclear research reactor Maria is named after her.[109]
The 7000 Curie asteroid is also named after her.[107]
A KLM McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (registration PH-KCC) is named in her honour.[110]
In 2011, a new Warsaw bridge over the Vistula River was named in her honour.[111]
In January 2020, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics
company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite; ÑuSat 8, also known as Marie, was named
in her honour.[112]
The Marie-Curie station, a planned underground Réseau express métropolitain (REM)
station in the borough of Saint-Laurent in Montreal is named in her honour.[113] A nearby
road, Avenue Marie Curie, is also named in her honour.
Several institutions presently bear her name, including the two Curie institutes which she founde d: the
Maria Sklodow ska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology in Warsaw, and the Institut Curie in
Paris. The Maria Curie-Skłodow ska University, in Lublin, was founde d in 1944;  and the Pierre and Marie
Curie University (also know n as Paris VI) was France's pre-eminent science university, which would later
merge to form the Sorbonne  University. In Britain, the Marie Curie charity was organized in 1948 to care
for the terminally ill.[114] Two museums are devoted to Marie Curie. In 1967, the Maria Skłodow ska-Curie
Museum was established in Warsaw's ""New Town"", at her birthplace on ulica Freta (Freta Street).[16] Her
Paris laboratory is preserved as the Musée Curie, ope n since 1992.[115]
Curie's likeness has appeared on bankno tes, stamps and coins around the world.[107] She was featured on
the Polish late-1980s  20,000- złoty banknot e[116] as well as on the last French 500-franc note, before the
franc was replaced by the euro.[117] Curie-themed postage stamps from Mali, the Republic of Togo,
Zambia, and the Republic of Guinea actually show a picture of Susan Marie Frontczak portraying Curie in
a 2001 pi cture by P aul Schroeder.[118]
Her likeness or name has appeared on several artistic works. In 1935, Michalina Mościcka, wife of Polish
President Ignacy Mościcki, unve iled a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw's Radium Institute; during the
1944 Second World War Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation, the monum ent was
damaged by gunfire; after the war it was decided to leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal.[16]
Her name is included on the Monum ent to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations, erected in
Hamburg, Germany in 1936.[119] In 1955 Jozef Mazur created a stained glass panel of her, the Maria
Skłodow ska-Curie Medallion, featured in the University at Buffalo Polish Room.[120] In 2011, on the
centenary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize, an allegorical mural was painted on the façade of her
Warsaw birthplace. It depicted an infant Maria Skłodow ska holding a test tube from which emanated the
elements that she would discover as an adult: polonium and radium.
In popular cultureNumerous biographies are devoted to her, including:
Ève Curie (Marie Curie's daughter), Madame Curie, 1938.
Françoise Giroud, Marie Curie: A Life, 1987.

Marie Curie has been the subject of a num ber of films:
1943: Madame Curie, a U.S. Oscar-nominated film by Mervyn LeRoy starring Greer
Garson.[71]
1997: Les Palmes de M. Schutz, a French film adapted from a play of the same title, and
directed by Claude Pinoteau. Marie Curie is played by Isabelle Huppert.[122]
2016: Marie Curie: The Courage of Knowledge, a European co-production by Marie Noëlle
starring Karolina Gruszka.
2019: Radioactive, a British film by Marjane Satrapi starring Rosamund Pike.
Curie is the subject of the 2013 play, False Assumptions, by Lawrence Aronovi tch, in which the ghosts of
three other women scientists observe events in her life.[123] Curie has also been portrayed by Susan Marie
Frontczak in her play, Manya: The Living History of Marie Curie, a one-woman show which by 2014 had
been performed in 30 U .S. states and ni ne countries.[118]

paper,"Radium and RadioactivityBy Mme. Sklodowska Curie, Discoverer of Radiumfrom Century Magazine (January 1904), pp. 461-466The discovery of the phenomena of radioactivity adds a new group to the great number of invisible radiations now known, and once more we are forced to recognize how limited is our direct perception of the world which surrounds us, and how numerous and varied may be the phenomena which we pass without a suspicion of their existence until the day when a fortunate hazard reveals them.The radiations longest known to us are those capable of acting directly upon our senses; such are the rays of sound and light. But it has also long been recognized that, besides light itself, warm bodies emit rays in every respect analogous to luminous rays, though they do not possess the power of directly impressing our retina. Among such radiations, some, the infra-red, announce themselves to us by producing a measurable rise of temperature in the bodies which receive them, while others, the ultra-violet, act with specially great intensity upon photographic plates. We have here a ﬁrst example of rays only indirectly accessible to us.Yet further surprises in this domain of invisible radiations were reserved for us. The researches of two great physicists, Maxwell and Hertz, showed that electric and magnetic effects are propagated in the same manner as light, and that there exist “electromagnetic radiations,” similar to luminous radiations, which are to the infra-red rays what these latter are to light. These are the electromagnetic radiations which are used for the transmission of messages in wireless telegraphy. They are present in the space around us whenever an electric phenomenon is produced, especially a lightning discharge. Their presence may be established by the use of special apparatus, and here again the testimony of our senses appears only in an indirect manner. If we consider these radiations in their entirety - the ultra-violet, the luminous, the infra-red, and the electromagnetic - we ﬁnd that the radiations we see constitute but an insigniﬁcant fraction of those that exist in space. But it is human nature to believe that the phenomena we know are the only ones that exist, and whenever some chance discovery extends the limits of our knowledge we are ﬁlled with amazement. We cannot become accustomed to the idea that we live in a world that is revealed to us only in a restricted portion of its manifestations.Among recent scientiﬁc achievements which have attracted most attention must be placed the discovery of cathode rays, and in even greater measure that of Roentgen rays. These rays are produced in vacuum-tubes when an electric discharge is passed through the rareﬁed gas. The prevalent opinion among physicists is that cathode rays are formed by extremely small material particles, charged with negative electricity, and thrown off with great velocity from the cathode, or negative electrode, of the tube. When the cathode rays meet the glass wall of the tube they render it vividly ﬂuorescent. These rays can be deﬂected from their straight path by the action of a magnet. Whenever they encounter a solid obstacle, the emission of Roentgen rays is the result. These latter can traverse the glass and propagate themselves through the outside air. They differ from cathode rays in that they carry no electric charge and are not deﬂected from their course by the action of a magnet. Everyone knows the effect of Roentgen rays upon photographic plates and upon ﬂuorescent screens, the radiographs obtainable from them, and their application in surgery.The discovery of Becquerel rays dates from a few years after that of Roentgen rays. At ﬁrst they were much less noticed. The world, attracted by the sensational discovery of Roentgen rays, was less inclined to astonishment. On all sides a search was instituted by similar processes for new rays, and announcements of phenomena were made that have not always been conﬁrmed. It has been only gradually that the positive existence of a new radiation has been established. The merit of this discovery belongs to M. Becquerel, who succeeded in demonstrating that uranium and its compounds spontaneously emit rays that are able to traverse opaque bodies and to affect photographic plates.It was at the close of the year 1897 that I began to study the compounds of uranium, the properties of which had greatly attracted my interest. Here was a substance emitting spontaneously and continuously radiations similar to Roentgen rays, whereas ordinarily Roentgen rays can be produced only in a vacuum-tube with the expenditure of energy. By what process can uranium furnish the same rays without expenditure of energy and without undergoing apparent modiﬁcation? Is uranium the only body whose compounds emit similar rays? Such were the questions I asked myself, and it was while seeking to answer them that I entered into the researches which have led to the discovery of radium.First of all, I studied the radiation of the compounds of uranium. Instead of making these bodies act upon photographic plates, I preferred to determine the intensity of their radiation by measuring the conductivity of the air exposed to the action of the rays. To make this measurement, one can determine the speed with which the rays discharge an electroscope, and thus obtain data for a comparison. I found in this way that the radiation of uranium is very constant, varying neither with the temperature nor with the illumination. I likewise observed that all the compounds of uranium are active, and that they are more active the greater the proportion of this metal which they contain. Thus I reached the conviction that the emission of rays by the compounds of uranium is a property of the metal itself—that it is an atomic property of the element uranium independent of its chemical or physical state. I then began to investigate the different known chemical elements, to determine whether there exist others, besides uranium, that are endowed with atomic radioactivity—that is to say, all the compounds of which emit Becquerel rays. It was easy for me to procure samples of all the ordinary substances—the common metals and metalloids, oxides and salts. But as I desired to make a very thorough investigation, I had recourse to different chemists, who put at my disposal specimens—in some cases the only ones in existence—containing very rare elements. I thus was enabled to pass in review all the chemical elements and to examine them in the state of one or more of their compounds. I found but one element undoubtedly possessing atomic radioactivity in measurable degree. This element is thorium. All the compounds of thorium are radioactive, and with about the same intensity as the similar compounds of uranium. As to the other substances, they showed no appreciable radioactivity under the conditions of the test.I likewise examined certain minerals. I found, as I expected, that the minerals of uranium and thorium are radioactive; but to my great astonishment I discovered that some are much more active than the oxides of uranium and of thorium which they contain. Thus a specimen of pitch-blende (oxide of uranium ore) was found to be four times more active than oxide of uranium itself. This observation astonished me greatly. What explanation could there be for it? How could an ore, containing many substances which I had proved inactive, be more active than the active substances of which it was formed? The answer came to me immediately: The ore must contain asubstance more radioactive than uranium and thorium, and this substance must necessarily be a chemical element as yet unknown; moreover, it can exist in the pitch-blende only in small quantities, else it would not have escaped the many analyses of this ore; but, on the other hand, it must possess intense radioactivity, since, although present in small amount, it produces such remarkable effects. I tried to verify my hypothesis by treating pitch-blende by the ordinary processes of chemical analysis, thinking it probable that the new substance would be concentrated in passing through certain stages of the process. I performed several experiments of this nature, and found that the ore could in fact be separated into portions some of which were much more radioactive than others.To try to isolate the supposed new element was a great temptation. I did not know whether this undertaking would be difﬁcult. Of the new element I knew nothing except that it was radioactive. What were its chemical properties? In what quantity did it appear in pitch-blende? I began the analysis of pitch-blende by separating it into its constituent elements, which are very numerous. This task I undertook in conjunction with M. Curie. We expected that perhaps a few weeks would sufﬁce to solve the problem. We did not suspect that we had begun a work which was to occupy years and which was brought to a successful issue only after considerable expenditure.We readily proved that pitch-blende contains very radioactive substances, and that there were at least three. That which accompanies the bismuth extracted from pitch-blende we named Polonium; that which accompanies barium from the same source we named Radium; ﬁnally, M. Debierne gave the name of Actinium to a substance which is found in the rare earths obtained from the same ore.Radium was to us from the beginning of our work a source of much satisfaction. Demarçay, who examined the spectrum of our radioactive barium, found in it new rays and conﬁrmed us in our belief that we had indeed discovered a new element.The question now was to separate the polonium from the bismuth, the radium from the barium. This is the task that has occupied us for years, and as yet we have succeeded only in the case of radium. The research has been a most difﬁcult one. We found that by crystallizing out the chloride of radioactive barium from a solution we obtained crystals that were more radioactive, and consequently richer in radium, than the chloride that remained dissolved. It was only necessary to make repeated crystallizations to obtain ﬁnally a pure chloride of radium.But although we treated as much as ﬁfty kilograms of primary substance, and crystallized the chloride of radiferous barium thus obtained until the activity was concentrated in a few minute crystals, these crystals still contained chieﬂy chloride of barium; as yet radium was present only in traces, and we saw that we could not ﬁnish our experiments with the means at hand in our laboratory. At the same time the desire to succeed grew stronger; for it became evident that radium must possess most intense radioactivity, and that the isolation of this body was therefore an object of the highest interest.Fortunately for us, the curious properties of these radium-bearing compounds had already attracted general attention and we were assisted in our search.A chemical factory in Paris consented to undertake the extraction of radium on a large scale. We also received certain pecuniary assistance, which allowed us to treat a large quantity of ore. Themost important of these grants was one of twenty thousand francs, for which we are indebted to the Institute of France.We were thus enabled to treat successively about seven tons of a primary substance which was the residue of pitch-blende after the extraction of uranium. Today we know that a ton of this residue contains from two to three decigrams (from four to seven ten-thousandths of a pound) of radium. During this treatment, and as soon as I had in my possession a decigram of chloride of radium recognized as pure by the spectroscope, I determined the atomic weight of this new element, ﬁnding it to be 225, while that of barium is 137.The properties of radium are extremely curious. This body emits with great intensity all of the different rays that are produced in a vacuum-tube. The radiation, measured by means of an electroscope, is at least a million times more powerful than that from an equal quantity of uranium. A charged electroscope placed at a distance of several meters can be discharged by a few centigrams of a radium salt. One can also discharge an electroscope through a screen of glass or lead ﬁve or six centimeters thick. Photographic plates placed in the vicinity of radium are also instantly affected if no screen intercepts the rays; with screens, the action is slower, but it still takes place through very thick ones if the exposure is sufﬁciently long. Radium can therefore be used in the production of radiographs.The compounds of radium are spontaneously luminous. The chloride and bromide, freshly prepared and free from water, emit a light which resembles that of a glow-worm. This light diminishes rapidly in moist air; if the salt is in a sealed tube, it diminishes slowly by reason of the transformation of the white salt, which becomes colored, but the light never completely disappears. By redissolving the salt and drying it anew, its original luminosity is restored.A glass vessel containing radium spontaneously charges itself with electricity. If the glass has a weak spot,—for example, if it is scratched by a ﬁle,—an electric spark is produced at that point, the vessel crumbles like a Leiden jar when overcharged, and the electric shock of the rupture is felt by the ﬁngers holding the glass.Radium possesses the remarkable property of liberating heat spontaneously and continuously. A solid salt of radium develops a quantity of heat such that for each gram of radium contained in the salt there is an emission of one hundred calories per hour. Expressed differently, radium can melt in an hour its weight in ice. When we reﬂect that radium acts in this manner continuously, we are amazed at the amount of heat produced, for it can be explained by no known chemical reaction.The radium remains apparently unchanged. If, then, we assume that it undergoes a transformation, we must therefore conclude that the change is extremely slow; in an hour it is impossible to detect a change by any known methods.As a result of its emission of heat, radium always possesses a higher temperature than its surroundings. This fact may be established by means of a thermometer, if care is taken to prevent the radium from losing heat.Radium has the power of communicating its radioactivity to surrounding bodies. This is a property possessed by solutions of radium salts even more than by the solid salts. When a solution of a radium salt is placed in a closed vessel, the radioactivity in part leaves the solution and distributes itself through the vessel, the walls of which become radioactive and luminous.The radiation is therefore in part exteriorized. We may assume, with Mr. Rutherford, that radium emits a radioactive gas and that this spreads through the surrounding air and over the surface of neighboring objects. This gas has received the name emanation. It differs from ordinary gas in the fact that it gradually disappears. [The modern name for this element is radon.]Certain bodies—bismuth, for instance—may also be rendered active by keeping them in solution with the salts of radium. These bodies then become atomically active, and keep this radioactivity even after chemical transformations. Little by little, however, they lose it, while the activity of radium persists.The nature of radium radiations is very complex. They may be divided into three distinct groups, according to their properties. One group is composed of radiations absolutely analogous to cathode rays, composed of material particles called electrons, much smaller than atoms, negatively charged, and projected from the radium with great velocity—a velocity which for some of these rays is very little inferior to that of light.The second group is composed of radiations which are believed to be formed by material particles the mass of which is comparable to that of atoms, charged with positive electricity, and set in motion by radium with a great velocity, but one that is inferior to that of the electrons. Being larger than electrons and possessing at the same time a smaller velocity, these particles have more difﬁculty in traversing obstacles and form rays that are less penetrating.Finally, the radiations of the third group are analogous to Roentgen rays and do not behave like projectiles.The radiations of the ﬁrst group are easily deﬂected by a magnet; those of the second group, less easily and in the opposite direction; those of the third group are not deﬂected. From its power of emitting these three kinds of rays, radium may be likened to a complete little Crookes tube acting spontaneously.Radium is a body which gives out energy continuously and spontaneously. This liberation of energy is manifested in the different effects of its radiation and emanation, and especially in the development of heat. Now, according to the most fundamental principles of modern science, the universe contains a certain deﬁnite provision of energy, which can appear under various forms, but cannot be increased.Without renouncing this conception, we cannot believe that radium creates the energy which it emits; but it can either absorb energy continuously from without, or possess in itself a reserve of energy sufﬁcient to act during a period of years without visible modiﬁcation. The ﬁrst theory we may develop by supposing that space is traversed by radiations that are as yet unknown to us, and that radium is able to absorb these radiations and transform their energy into the energy of radioactivity. Thus in a vacuum-tube the electric energy is utilized to produce cathode rays, and the energy of the latter is partly transformed, by the bodies which absorb them into the energy of Roentgen rays. It is true that we have no proof of the existence of radiations which produce radioactivity; but, as indicated at the beginning of this article, there is nothing improbable in supposing that such radiations exist about us without our suspecting it.If we assume that radium contains a supply of energy which it gives out little by little, we are ledto believe that this body does not remain unchanged, as it appears to, but that it undergoes an extremely slow change. Several reasons speak in favor of this view. First, the emission of heat, which makes it seem probable that a chemical reaction is taking place in the radium. But this can be no ordinary chemical reaction, affecting the combination of atoms in the molecule. No chemical reaction can explain the emission of heat due to radium. Furthermore, radioactivity is a property of the atom of radium; if, then, it is due to a transformation this transformation must take place in the atom itself. Consequently, from this point of view, the atom of radium would be in a process of evolution, and we should be forced to abandon the theory of the invariability of atoms, which is at the foundation of modern chemistry.Moreover, we have seen that radium acts as though it shot out into space a shower of projectiles, some of which have the dimensions of atoms, while others can only be very small fractions of atoms. If this image corresponds to a reality, it follows necessarily that the atom of radium breaks up into subatoms of different sizes, unless these projectiles come from the atoms of the surrounding gas, disintegrated by the action of radium; but this view would likewise lead us to believe that the stability of atoms is not absolute.Radium emits continuously a radioactive emanation which, from many points of view, possesses the properties of a gas. Mr. Rutherford considers the emanation as one of the results of the disintegration of the atom of radium, and believes it to be an unstable gas which is itself slowly decomposed.Professor Ramsay has announced that radium emits helium gas continuously. If this very important fact is conﬁrmed, it will show that a transformation is occurring either in the atom of radium or in the neighboring atoms, and a proof will exist that the transmutation of the elements is possible. [In fact radium does emit helium, as alpha particles.]When a body that has remained in solution with radium becomes radioactive, the chemical properties of this body are modiﬁed, and here again it seems as though we have to deal with a modiﬁcation of the atom. It would be very interesting to see whether, by thus giving radioactivity to bodies, we can succeed in causing an appreciable change in their atoms. We should thus have a means of producing certain transformations of elements at will. [These observations were misleading. True artiﬁcial radioactivity was not produced until the work of Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1934.]It is seen that the study of the properties of radium is of great interest. This is true also of the other strongly radioactive substances, polonium and actinium, which are less known because their preparation is still more difﬁcult. All are found in the ores of uranium and thorium, and this fact is certainly not the result of chance, but must have some connection with the manner of formation of these elements. Polonium, when it has just been extracted from pitch-blende, is as active as radium, but its radioactivity slowly disappears; actinium has a persistent activity. These two bodies differ from radium in many ways; their study should therefore be fertile in new results. Actinium lends itself readily to the study of the emanation and of the radioactivity produced in inactive bodies, since it gives out emanation in great quantity. It would also be interesting, from the chemical point of view, to prove that polonium and actinium contain new elements. Finally, one might seek out still other strongly radioactive substances and study them.But all these investigations are exceedingly difﬁcult because of the obstacles encountered in thepreparation of strongly radioactive substances. At the present time we possess only about a gram of pure salts of radium. Research in all branches of experimental science—physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine—is impeded, and a whole evolution in science is retarded, by the lack of this precious and unique material, which can now be obtained only at great expense. We must now look to individual initiative to come to the aid of science, as it has so often done in the past, and to facilitate and expedite by generous gifts the success of researches the inﬂuence of which may be far-reaching."

ABSTRACT
The year 2006 marked 100 years since the death of
Pierre Curie. It is therefore appropriate that we remem-ber his life and his work, which was cut short by his
untimely death from an accident on the Pont Neuf, Paris,
on April 19, 1906. He had already accomplished muchduring his life, both before the discovery of radium with
Marie Curie, in work co-authored with his brother
Jacques on piezoelectricity, and afterwards, when hepublished the results of several experimental studies
with radium and radon. He came from a medical fam-
ily, and his grandfather Pierre Curie was a famous ho-meopathic physician. He has, in print, unfairly been
relegated to the background—his own scientific con-
tributions having been overtaken by the fame of MarieCurie, probably because she outlived him by 28 years.
KEY WORDS
Pierre Curie, piezoelectricity, radium, radioactivity
1. INTRODUCTION
Only a single biography 1 has been written on Pierre
Curie, as compared with more than ten on Marie
Curie. Pierre Curie’s papers were published in 1908 2,
after his death, because such publication was thenthe policy in Paris for many famous scientists.
Today, it is largely forgotten that the Curie broth-
ers discovered piezoelectricity 3–5, a phenomenon that
enabled the development of the piezoelectrometer. That
instrument was used for the early scientific measure-
ments of radium preparations. Pierre Curie was instru-mental with Marie Curie in discovering both polonium
 6
and radium 7, but besides his several joint papers with
her, he also published alone and with other authors.The division of work between the Curies was largely
split into chemistry for Marie and physics for Pierre.
2. THE CURIE FAMILY
The Curie family originated from Mulhouse in Alsace
before the German annexation of Alsace and Lorraineat the end of the nineteenth century. Pierre Curie’s
grandfather, Paul Étienne François Gustave, and fa-
ther, Eugène, were physicians. Eugène was brought
up in Paris and studied natural sciences and medi-cine at the Musée d’Histoire naturelle at 47 rue Cuvier
where, later, Henri Becquerel was to be professor of
physics and to discover radioactivity. It was also in ahouse in the rue Cuvier, number 16, that Pierre Curie
was born. Later, at 12 rue Cuvier, the Laboratoire
Curie was established by the Sorbonne in 1904. Thelaboratory remained on that site until 1914, when the
Institut du Radium was built in rue Pierre Curie.
Of the first three generations in the family, only
Eugène Curie never published. Paul established him-
self as a physician in England working at the London
Homeopathic Infirmary 8–12 having previously worked
as a surgeon in the Military Hospital of Paris (Fig-
ure 1). In the Curie family tree shown in Figure 2, only
Eve Curie was not a scientist; however, she was theauthor of the first biography of Marie Curie
 13. Maurice
and Daniel were both physicists. Hélène is a nuclear
physicist, and Pierre, a biochemist.
In 1903, Pierre and Marie, with Henri Becquerel,
were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1911,
Marie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In1935, Irène and Frédéric were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. In 1965, Henri Labouisse received
the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of 
UNICEF.
Starting in 1913, Maurice Curie 14–17 worked for
a year with Marie Curie in the Laboratoire Curie in
the rue Cuvier, and throughout World War I, he cor-responded with her. He spent 12 months on the front
line before 1917, mostly near Verdun, but he survived
the war. Son Daniel published with his father
 17,18.
Pierre’s death was reported on April 20, 1906, in
the French newspaper Le Matin.  The headline read
“M. Pierre CURIE, le savant qui découvrit le radium,a été écrasé dans la rue et tué net par un camion....

3. ALFRED CURIE
It should perhaps also be noted that the Dr. Alfred
Curie who is said to be the inventor of the formula
for the cosmetic Tho-Radia face cream (Figure 3) was
not a member of Pierre Curie’s family—although hewas indeed a Curie.For many years, even the director of the Musée
Curie in Paris assumed that he was “un médecin qui
n’a jamais existé!” 20 And all radium historians until
2003 also considered that he was a mythical person
used only for the promotion of beauty products in the
1920s (Huchette N, Musée Curie. Personal commu-nication, October 2003). However, it now transpires
that, although the mysterious Alfred was not related
to Pierre Curie, he nevertheless existed
 21, and in 1911,
for his doctorate in medicine from the University of
Paris, he submitted a thesis titled Treatment of Spina
Bifida 22. He was traced through annual copies of
Le Guide Rosenwald,  which lists all French doctors
and which shows that, in 1912, he was an internist at
L’Hôpital de Clichy. Afterwards, he seems to havebeen in general practice, having set up a private clinic.
He was born in 1973 and died in Paris in 1940
 21.
Whether it was really Alfred Curie—or an Egyp-
tian pharmacist, Alexis Moussalli—who invented the
formula is not known, but nevertheless a formula for
Tho-Radia did actually exist 21. For the face cream, the
radioactivity consisted of 0.5 g thorium chloride and
0.25 mg radium bromide per 100 g of cream. The Tho-
Radia patent (“marque”) was registered by the Tribu-nal de Commerce de la Seine on November 29, 1932.
It is probable that the commercial mastermind
behind Tho-Radia was Alexis Moussalli. This doc-tor of pharmacy, who had been born in Cairo, Egypt,
in 1894, submitted his thesis to the University of
Nancy on the subject of “le bacille pyocyanique etles bacilles de la dysenterie”
 23. During the period
1927–1934, he patented 101 preparations based on
radium or radioactive substances, but only Tho-Radiaand Crème Radio-Thorium used a formula devised

Laboradium, Microradium, Radiobust, Radiofluide,
Radioskin, Radium Cure, and Radiviril. Moussalli
ceased his activities in 1956, although it is unknownif that was the year he died.
4. PIEZOELECTRICITY AND
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
Pierre received his early education at home before
entering the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne and
obtaining his Licence in Physics in 1878. He then con-
tinued as a demonstrator in the Sorbonne’s physicslaboratory, where he worked with his brother Jacques.
In 1883, Jacques left to take up the head lectureship
in mineralogy at the University of Montpellier.Montpellier being in the south of France and very dis-
tant from Paris, Jacques’ move ended the scientific
collaboration of the brothers, but not before they hadcompleted important studies on the electric proper-
ties of crystals and had discovered piezoelectricity
 3–5.
In 1883, Pierre also left the Sorbonne. He took
charge of all the practical work (Chef de travaux pra-
tique) and eventually became Professeur de Physique
Générale et Electricité Théorie at the École Supérieurede Physique et de Chimie Industrielles (
ESPCI), which
until 1946 was called the École Municipale de Phy-
sique et de Chimie Industrielles. He was to remainthere for 22 years, obtaining his Doctor of Science
degree in 1895
 24. In 1900, he returned to the
Sorbonne as a professor in the Faculty of Sciences.
As early as the eighteenth century, the crystals of
some minerals were known to generate an electric
charge when heated; the phenomenon was calledpyroelectricity. The phenomenon of piezoelectricity
(named after the Greek piezein, meaning to squeeze
or press) was discovered by the Curie brothers whenthey showed that crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz,
cane sugar, and Rochelle salt generated electrical
polarization under mechanical stress. Piezoelectricityfrom a thin slice of quartz was the basis for the Curie
electrometer.
The first practical application of the discovery
(after the measurement of radioactivity) was in a so-
nar piezoelectric device. This ultrasonic submarine
detector was developed in 1917—during WorldWar I—by Paul Langevin, who had been one of
Pierre’s students at 
ESPCI. The device consisted of a
transducer (made of thin quartz crystals carefully gluedbetween two steel plates) and a hydrophone to detect
the returning echo. The transducer emits a high-fre-
quency note of sound. By measuring the time taken tohear the echo of the sound waves returning from an
object, the distance to the object can be calculated.
5. THE CURIE POINT
Pierre Curie’s name is not only commemorated by
the Curie piezoelectrometer, but also by the Curiepoint (or Curie temperature) of ferromagnetic mate-
rial. The Curie point is the temperature above which
the material loses its characteristic ferromagnetic
properties. In an analogy to ferromagnetism, the Curiepoint is also used to describe the temperature above
which piezoelectric materials lose their spontaneous
polarization and piezoelectric properties. During theperiod 1880–1895, without any collaboration with
his brother, Pierre Curie undertook further research
into piezoelectricity, crystal symmetry, and the Curiepoint
 25–28.
6. POLONIUM AND RADIUM
In 1898, Pierre Curie ceased his studies on piezo-electricity and crystallography to be able to concen-trate solely on working with Marie Curie—a
collaboration that culminated in the discovery of polo-
nium and radium
 6,7. This phase of Pierre’s life is very
well documented not only in scientific publications,
but also in popular magazines and journals. Invari-
ably, the latter were illustrated with not-very-goodrepresentations of Pierre and Marie working together
in their rue Lhomond laboratory.
In his Nobel address, Pierre Curie made the fol-
lowing famous statement:
It is possible to conceive that, in criminal
hands, radium might prove very dangerous,in their rue Lhomond laboratory.
In his Nobel address, Pierre Curie made the fol-
lowing famous statement:
It is possible to conceive that, in criminal
hands, radium might prove very dangerous,
and the question therefore arises whether it
be to the advantage of humanity to know thesecrets of nature, whether we will be suffi-
ciently mature to profit by them, or whether
that knowledge may not prove harmful.
Take for instance the discoveries of
Nobel: Powerful explosives have made it
possible to achieve admirable things, but theyare also a terrible means of destruction in the
hands of those great criminals who draw na-
tions into war. I am among those who be-lieve with Nobel that humanity will obtain
more good than evil from future discoveries
(Curie P. Radioactive substances, especiallyradium. Presented in Stockholm, June 6,
1905).
7. SELF-EXPOSURE RADIUM BURNS
7.1 Friedrich Walkoff and Friedrich Giesel
The first self-exposure experiments were made not
by Henri Becquerel, but by two Germans: FriedrichWalkoff and Friedrich Giesel. (Giesel worked for the
Buchler company in Brunswick, Buchler being the
first producer of radium sources in Germany.) InOctober 1900, Giesel described in a scientific jour-
nal the strapping of 270 mg of radium salt to his in-
ner forearm for a duration of two hours
 29; he also
wrote about it to Pierre Curie (Joliot–Langevin H.PIERRE CURIE
CURRENT ONCOLOGY—VOLUME 14, NUMBER 277Personal communication, October 2004). The
Walkoff reference of 1900 30 consisted of just three
lines in a three-page general review (dealing mainly
with photographic questions) presented to a photo-graphic club in Munich. The review was published
in the October 1900 issue of Photographische
Rundschau: Zeitschrift für Freunde der Photo-graphie. The title, translated into English, is “Invis-
ible, photographically effective rays.” I am most
grateful to Dr. Jean Dutreix, for the translation andcomments that follow.
Walkoff wrote:
Furthermore, radium owns astonishing
physiologic properties. An exposure of the
arm to two 20-minute sessions has producedan inflammation of the skin which has now
lasted already for two weeks, and exhibits the
same aspect as that obtained after a long ex-posure to X-rays. Trials still not completed,
made in the Munich Hygiene Institute, seem
to show an effect on micro-organisms.
An interesting question is posed (and answered
below) by Dutreix: “Is this a personal experiment, oris he reporting on an experiment made by his friend
Friedrich Giesel?” The details are scarce but precise:
two exposures of 20 minutes and a skin inflamma-tion now lasting for two weeks. A few lines above
his radium comments, Walkoff reports on two of his
own photographic experiments. Why not on the skinexperiment, which is so casually presented? The first
impression, therefore, is that Walkoff is mentioning
an experiment undertaken by someone else.
However, the following three points incline us to
believe that the two skin trials by Walkoff and Giesel
are not connected and that they are two separateexperiments:
• Walkoff writes: “Dr. Giesel, out of friendliness,
put at my disposal 0.2 g of radium much coveted
by the physicists [ physiker— physicist, and not
physician] for physiologic trials.”
• In the description of the reaction “now last[ing]
already for two weeks” suggests that Walkoff is
acquainted with the follow-up. Is this personalinformation or information from Giesel?
• Walkoff pays credit to his “friend Giesel for pro-
ducing polonium and radium,” but does not men-tion any physiologic trials undertaken by Giesel.
Because Walkoff warmly expresses his gratitude
to Giesel, it can be assumed that if he were refer-ring to an experiment by Giesel, he would have
had the courtesy to mention this fact.
In conclusion, an interesting observation relat-
ing to Friedrich Giesel was later published in 1905
 31
and clearly shows the hazards of commercially pre-
paring the early radium sources: “Giesel’s breath wasso radioactive that it would still discharge an electro-
scope 18 hours after he left his laboratory, and
Giesel’s body was the most radioactive that had yet
been measured.”
7.2 Henri Becquerel and Pierre Curie
Becquerel’s radium burn was often reported to have
been “accidental” after he had placed a radium source
inside his jacket pocket. However, Becquerel gavecredit for the first observations to Walkoff and
Giesel
 29,30, and together with Pierre Curie, to whom
Giesel had previously written (Joliot–Langevin H.Personal communication, October 2004), Becquerel
reported his own self-exposure measurements with
radium
 32 with a source placed many times in a pocket
of his jacket.
Marie Curie, in her biography of Pierre Curie 1,
describes Becquerel’s reaction to the experience ofreceiving a radium burn:
In order to test the results that had just
been announced by F. Giesel, Pierre Curie
voluntarily exposed his arm to the action of
radium during several hours. This resulted ina lesion resembling a burn that developed
progressively and required several months to
heal. Henri Becquerel had by accident a simi-lar burn as a result of carrying in his vest
pocket a glass tube containing radium salt.
He came to tell us of this evil effect of ra-dium, exclaiming in a manner at once de-
lighted and annoyed: “I love it, but I owe it a
grudge.”
What now follows is the English translation—He came to tell us of this evil effect of ra-dium, exclaiming in a manner at once de-
lighted and annoyed: “I love it, but I owe it a
grudge.”
What now follows is the English translation—
for which I am most grateful to Dr. BernardAsselain—of the text of the Becquerel and Curie
paper
 32, in which, toward the end, a mention is made
that Marie Curie also conducted radium self-expo-sure experiments:
Radium radiations act energetically on the
skin: the effect produced is close to that pro-
duced with Röntgen X-rays. First observa-
tions of this action are due to Walkoff andGiesel in 1900. Mr. Giesel applied to his arm
for two hours, radiferous radium bromide
placed in a celluloid sheet. Radiations actingthrough the celluloid provoked a light red
colour of the skin. Two or three weeks later,
the red colour increased, and an inflamma-tion of the tissues appeared, and the skin
sloughed off.
Mr. Curie reproduced on himself the
Giesel experiment letting it act for 10 hours
on his arm, through a thin sheet of gutta
percha, the radiferous barium chloride[“Radiferous barium” is not a misprint forMOULD

mately 5000 times the activity of metallicuranium]. After the action of the radiations,
the skin became red over a 6-cm
2 surface. The
result was similar to that of a skin burn, butthe skin was not painful. After some days, the
red colour increased without spreading. On
the 20th day, scabs were formed and then anopen wound needing covering up. On the 42nd
day, the epidermis started to recover around
the wound, reaching the centre, and 52 daysafter the action of the radiations, an area of
1 cm
2 of a grey colouration remained, indi-
cating a deeper necrosis.
Mr. Becquerel, bringing a small sealed
tube of a few decigrams of radiferous barium
chloride of a high activity level [800,000 timesthe activity of uranium] underwent the same
experiment. The radiferous product was en-
closed in a sealed glass tube, and the cylindri-cal volume was about 10–15 mm in length and
3 mm in diameter. The tube, enclosed in a
sheet of paper was inside a small cardboardbox. On April 3 and 4, this small box was
placed many times in a pocket of his jacket,
the total time being assessed as a 6-hour ex-posure. On April 13, he discovered that the
radiations through the tube, the box, and the
clothes produced a red spot on the skin whichbecame darker in the next days: marking in
red the oblong size of the tube, with an oval
shape of 6×4 cm
2. On April 24, the skin
sloughed off and then the central part became
ulcerated with a discharge. The wound was
treated during 1 month with a bandage withoil and calcar. Necrosed tissues sloughed off,
and on May 22—that is, 49 days after the ir-
radiation—the wound was repaired, leavinga scar marking the position of the tube.
During the treatment of the burn, a sec-
ond oblong spot appeared on about May 15at the place of the opposite corner of the jacket
pocket where the radioactive tube was placed.
The action was dated either at the same dateas the first one, or more likely on April 11,
even if it lasted a very short time, no more
than one hour. Erythema thus appeared34 days at least after the initial action. Inflam-
mation progressed with the aspect of a su-
perficial burn. On May 26, the skin began toslough off. With the same care as for the first
one, this burn was cured more quickly. Dur-
ing the period of observation, on April 10,11, and 12, the same radioactive tube was putin another pocket of the jacket, but enclosed
in a lead tube of about 5 mm thickness. The
tube was kept in the pocket for 40 hours, and
no effect was observed.
We can add that Madame Curie, carry-
ing in a small sealed tube only a few centi-
grams of the same very active substance thatgave the above mentioned lesions, presented
with similar burns, although this little tube
was enclosed in a thin metallic box. For in-stance, a short action, during less than 30 min-
utes, produced 15 days later a red spot which
was transformed into a blister similar to thatdue to a superficial burn that takes 15 days
to be cured. These facts show that the dura-
tion of the lesion’s evolution varies accord-ing to the intensity of the radiation and the
duration of the excitation action.
After these effects we have described, we
experimented on our hands the different ac-
tions during researches with these very ac-
tive products. Hands have a general trend tobecome scaly, and the extremities of the fin-
gers which held tubes or capsules containing
very radioactive products become hard andsometimes very painful. For one of us, the
inflammation of the extremities of the fingers
lasted about 15 days and finished when theskin dropped off, but the painful sensation
did not disappear for two months.”
 32
Figure 4 was for many years assumed to be alasted about 15 days and finished when theskin dropped off, but the painful sensation
did not disappear for two months.”
 32
Figure 4 was for many years assumed to be a
newspaper photograph of Pierre Curie’s self-expo-
sure radium burn on his forearm. That assumptionwas made because the Marie Sklodowska Curie
Museum in Warsaw only ever showed the photograph
on its own without any wording. Comptes rendus de
l’Academie des sciences
 32 gave a full description of
the experiment, but did not include this photograph.
The mystery of the provenance of Figure 4 deep-
ened when the photograph could not be located in
any early textbooks on radium and X-rays held in

library, the library of the Welcome Institute for the
History of Medicine, the Royal Society of Medicine
library, or the library of the Science Museum, Impe-rial College, London. The provenance was solved
only in 2006 when the elusive textbook
 33 containing
the photograph of Pierre Curie’s radium burn wasfound to be titled Radium and Radio-Active Sub-
stances, written in 1905 by Charles Baskerville. How-
ever, that discovery does not solve the mystery ofwhat the Success Company was.
Baskerville commences his radium biology chap-
ter
 33 with reference to the experiences of Walkoff 29
and Giesel 30, and when referring to Figure 4, quotes
“Madame Curie’s thesis” as the source for the state-
ment “the action of radium upon the skin can takeplace across metal screens, but with weakened ef-
fect”
 34. Indeed, Baskerville’s exact wording really
is from Marie Curie’s thesis and can be found in thelatest English translation (of 2002)
 35, which is an
unabridged republication of the English 1904 trans-
lation published by Van Nostrand in New York 36.
8. RESEARCH PAPERS
During the period 1900–1906, Pierre Curie published
twenty-one papers (Table I), either alone or with co-
authors other than Marie Curie. Only one of thesewas with Henri Becquerel
 32 (in 1901), and that paper
includes the self-exposure experiments described
earlier. Those experiments in turn led Pierre Curie toloan some radium to Henri Danlos, a dermatologist
at the Hôpital St-Louis, Paris, for the first radium treat-
ment in France of (non-malignant) skin disease
 37. A
second paper on the physiologic action of radon (ra-
dium emanation) was published in 1904 38, demon-
strating Pierre Curie’s continued interest in radiumand radon therapy.
The first two topics in the list from Table I attracted
much early interest. In regard to the first paper, twotypes of Becquerel rays, deviable and non-deviable,
were initially considered to exist. The former were
beta rays, and the latter, alpha rays. However, the alpharays were non-deviable only because the tested mag-
netic field was not of sufficient strength for any de-
viation to be detected. The second paper referred toreports that radium could induce radioactivity in other
materials. However, as Ernest Rutherford later dem-onstrated, that phenomenon, which was common to
thorium and thoron and to radium and radon, was at-
tributable to an active deposit.
In comparison with Table I, Table II lists the top-
ics on which Marie Curie published during 1900–
1906. Of a total of thirteen papers, she is the sole
author of all of them. This period also included thepublication of her doctoral thesis
 35,36.
Pierre Curie’s final paper 39 was published on
June 25, 1906—some two months after his death.Figure 5 shows Marie and Pierre Curie circa 1906.
9. LABORATORY WORKING CONDITIONS IN
1903
In 1903, the American journalist Cleveland Moffett
interviewed 40 Pierre Curie in the rue Lhomond, in the
laboratory where polonium and radium had been dis-
covered in 1898 6,7. This interview was one of the very
few recorded with Pierre Curie, and Moffett’s descrip-
tion of an accident with radium is very interesting:
I found him in one of the rambling sheds
of the École de Physique bending over a small
porcelain dish, where a colourless liquid wassimmering, perhaps half a teacupful, and he
was watching it with concern, always fearful
of some accident. He had lost nearly adecigram (1.5 grains troy) of radium only a
few weeks previously, he said, in a curious

small tube, and this inside another tube, in
which he created a vacuum. Then he began
to heat both tubes over an electric furnace,when suddenly at about 2000°F, there came
an explosion which shattered the tubes and
scattered their precious contents. There wasabsolutely no explanation of this explosion;
it was one of the tricks that radium is apt to
play on you. Here his face lightened withquite a boyish smile.
One demonstration by Pierre Curie for Moffett
involved the use of radium to illuminate a page for
reading purposes. Moffett recorded it as follows:
M. Curie took me into a darkened room
where I saw quite plainly the light from the
radium tube, a clear glow sufficient to readby if the tube were held near a printed page.
And of course this was a very small quantity
of radium, about 6 centigram. “We estimate,”said Pierre Curie, “that a decigram of radium
will illuminate 15 square inches of surface suf-
ficient for reader.” In addition he estimatedthat “a kilogram [2.2 pounds] of radium would
illuminate a room 30 feet square with a mild
radiance; and the light would be much brighterif screens of sulphide of zinc were placed near
the radium, for these are thrown by the metal
into brilliant phosphorescence.”
 40
Pierre Curie was well aware of the dangers in-
volved and concluded, “For some time to come theradium light will only be a laboratory wonder.” He
also gave an “outside estimate” of the amount of ra-
dium then in the world being only 4 g—one third ofan ounce in France, one gram in Germany, less than
one gram in the United States, and half a gram in the
rest of the world—and that “you could heap it all in atablespoon,” and “a kilogram of radium would cost
about 10 million francs, and that radium is worth
about 3000 times its weight in pure gold.” (Table 
III
gives the costs of radium for the period 1899–
1938 41–47.)
Pierre Curie also mentioned 40 that he had just
returned from London, lecturing at The Royal Insti-
tution, and that “his hands had become much peeled,
and very sore from too much contact with radium,and for several days he had been unable to dress him-
self.” Earlier Moffett had also remarked on the bio-
logic effect of radium, reporting that “Pierre Curiepulled up his sleeve and showed me a forearm scarred
and reddened from fresh healed sores.”
10.TEACHING EXPERIMENT
Table I shows the topics of Pierre Curie’s research
experiments, but it should be emphasized that hisprofessional life also included a significant amount
of teaching. Figure 6 shows him in 1904 at the lec-
ture theatre in the rue Cuvier with glassware from
one of his standard experiments. He used this experi-ment to demonstrate for his students the phenomenon
of radioactivity.
Moffett provides the only full description of this
experiment
 40, considering that it was “the most strik-
ing experiment” performed by Pierre Curie and the
“one devised by him to prove the existence of radiumTABLE IIICosts of 1 g radium, 1899–1938 41–47—by comparison,

ent from the rays) which this extraordinary metal
seems to throw off constantly as it throws off heat
and light.”
Figure 7 is Moffett’s schematic diagram of the
experiment. The experiment itself was described in
these terms:
M. Curie constructed an apparatus in
which a glass tube R, containing a solution
of radium is connected to two glass bulbs, A
and B, containing sulphide of zinc. The ex-
periment is begun by exhausting the air fromthe two bulbs A and B, by means of air pump
connections through the tube E. The air is not
exhausted, however, from the tube R, over
which the stop-cock F is closed, and within
which the emanations have been allowed to
accumulate. The room is now darkened, andit is seen that so long as the stop-cock F re-
mains closed there is no glow in bulbs A and
B, but as soon as the stop-cock F is opened
both bulbs shine brilliantly, so that the light
is plainly visible at a distance of several hun-
dred yards. Now, obviously if this effect weredue to the radium rays, it would be produced
whether the stop-cock F were open or closed,
since the radium rays pass freely throughglass and need not follow the tube S in order
to reach the bulbs A and B.
It is therefore clear that the sudden light
in the bulbs is due to the passage of some-
thing out of the tube R, and through the
tube S, that something  being kept back by theglass of the bulb R until the stop-cock F is
opened. So that we conclude that the emana-
tions of radium cannot pass through glass and
are a manifestation quite distinct from the raysof radium, which can pass through but do not
influence the sulphide of zinc.
This point having been established,
M. Curie proceeded to the most sensational
part of his demonstration, by closing the stop-
cock F and then placing the lower bulb B, still
radiant, in a vessel G containing liquid air,
the result being that the light in the bulb B
gradually grew stronger while the light in thebulb A diminished, until presently, all the
light seemed concentrated in B and gone from
A, the conclusion being that the intense cold
of liquid air had produced some change in
the emanations, has possibly reduced them
from a gas to a liquid, this withdrawing themfrom A to B and checking the one glow while
increasing the other.
 40
Moffett’s legend to Figure 7 was “M. Curie ex-
plaining the wonders of radium at the Sorbonne. This
experiment with the radium light is described in thisarticle.”

She was the, first woman to win a Nobel Prize,  the first person to, win a Nobel Prize twice,  and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie,  was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize,  making them the, first married couple, to win the Nobel Prize and launching the, Curie family legacy, of five Nobel Prizes. She was,  in 1906,  the first woman to become a professor at the, University of Paris, ., [, 2, ], She was born in, Warsaw,  in what was then the, Kingdom of Poland,  part of the, Russian Empire, . She studied at Warsaw's clandestine, Flying University, and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891,  aged 24,  she followed her elder sister, Bronisława, to study in Paris,  where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895,  she married the French physicist, Pierre Curie,  and she shared the 1903, Nobel Prize in Physics, with him and with the physicist, Henri Becquerel, for their pioneering work developing the theory of ""radioactivity""—a term she coined., [, 3, ], [, 4, ], In 1906,  Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, for her discovery of the elements, polonium, and, radium,  using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive, isotopes, . Under her direction,  the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of, neoplasms, by the use of radioactive isotopes. She founded the, Curie Institute in Paris, in 1920,  and the, Curie Institute in Warsaw, in 1932; both remain major medical research centres. During, World War I,  she developed mobile radiography units to provide, X-ray, services to, field hospitals, ., While a French citizen,  Marie Skłodowska Curie,  who used both surnames, [, 5, ], [, 6, ], never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland., [, 7, ], She named the first, chemical element, she discovered, polonium,  after her native country., [, b, ], Marie Curie died in 1934,  aged 66,  at the, Sancellemoz, sanatorium, in, Passy, (, Haute-Savoie, ),  France,  of, aplastic anemia, likely from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during, World War I, ., [, 9, ], In addition to her Nobel Prizes,  she received numerous other honours and tributes; in 1995 she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Paris, Panthéon, [, 10, ], and Poland declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie during the, International Year of Chemistry, . She is the subject of numerous biographical works., Life and career, Early years, Władysław Skłodowski and daughters (from left) Maria, Bronisława,  and, Helena,  1890, Maria Skłodowska was born in, Warsaw,  in, Congress Poland, in the, Russian Empire,  on 7 November 1867,  the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers, [, 11, ], Bronisława, née, Boguska,  and Władysław Skłodowski., [, 12, ], The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed, Mania, ) were Zofia (born 1862,  nicknamed, Zosia, ), Józef, [, pl, ], (born 1863,  nicknamed, Józio, ), Bronisława, (born 1865,  nicknamed, Bronia, ) and, Helena, (born 1866,  nicknamed, Hela, )., [, 13, ], [, 14, ], On both the paternal and maternal sides,  the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the, January Uprising, of 1863–65)., [, 15, ], This condemned the subsequent generation,  including Maria and her elder siblings,  to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life., [, 15, ], Maria's paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodowski, [, pl, ],  had been principal of the, Lublin, primary school attended by, Bolesław Prus, [, 16, ], who became a leading figure in Polish literature., [, 17, ], Władysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics,  subjects that Maria was to pursue,  and was also director of two Warsaw, gymnasia, (secondary schools) for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools,  he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed his children in its use., [, 13, ], He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house., [, 13, ], Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born., [, 13, ], She died of, tuberculosis, in May 1878,  when Maria was ten years old., [, 13, ], Less than three years earlier,  Maria's oldest sibling,  Zofia,  had died of, typhus, contracted from a boarder., [, 13, ], Maria's father was an, atheist,  her mother a devout Catholic., [, 18, ], The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic., [, 19, ], Maria (left) and sister, Bronisława, c., 1886, When she was ten years old,  Maria began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next,  she attended a, gymnasium, for girls,  from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal., [, 12, ], After a collapse,  possibly due to depression, [, 13, ], she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father,  and the next year with her father in Warsaw,  where she did some tutoring., [, 12, ], Unable to enrol in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman,  she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine, Flying University, (sometimes translated as, Floating University, ),  a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students., [, 12, ], [, 13, ], Krakowskie Przedmiescie, 66, Warsaw,  where Maria did her first scientific work,  1890–91, Maria made an agreement with her sister,  Bronisława,  that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris,  in exchange for similar assistance two years later., [, 12, ], [, 20, ], In connection with this,  Maria took a position first as a home tutor in Warsaw,  then for two years as a, governess, in, Szczuki, with a landed family,  the Żorawskis,  who were relatives of her father., [, 12, ], [, 20, ], While working for the latter family,  she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski,  a future eminent mathematician., [, 20, ], His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative,  and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them., [, 20, ], Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician,  becoming a professor and, rector, of, Kraków University, . Still,  as an old man and a mathematics professor at the, Warsaw Polytechnic,  he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska that had been erected in 1935 before the, Radium Institute,  which she had founded in 1932., [, 15, ], [, 21, ], At the beginning of 1890,  Bronisława—who a few months earlier had married, Kazimierz Dłuski,  a Polish physician and social and political activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds., [, 12, ], She was helped by her father,  who was able to secure a more lucrative position again., [, 20, ], All that time she continued to, educate herself,  reading books,  exchanging letters,  and being tutored herself., [, 20, ], In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw., [, 12, ], She continued working as a governess and remained there until late 1891., [, 20, ], She tutored,  studied at the Flying University,  and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemistry laboratory at the, Museum of Industry and Agriculture, at, Krakowskie Przedmieście, 66,  near, Warsaw's Old Town, ., [, 12, ], [, 13, ], [, 20, ], The laboratory was run by her cousin, Józef Boguski,  who had been an assistant in, Saint Petersburg, to the Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleyev, ., [, 12, ], [, 20, ], [, 22, ], Life in Paris, In late 1891,  she left Poland for France., [, 23, ], In Paris,  Maria (or Marie,  as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a, garret, closer to the university,  in the, Latin Quarter,  and proceeding with her studies of physics,  chemistry,  and mathematics at the, University of Paris,  where she enrolled in late 1891., [, 24, ], [, 25, ], She subsisted on her meagre resources,  keeping herself warm during cold winters by wearing all the clothes she had. She focused so hard on her studies that she sometimes forgot to eat., [, 25, ], Skłodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings,  barely earning her keep. In 1893,  she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of, Gabriel Lippmann, . Meanwhile,  she continued studying at the University of Paris and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894., [, 12, ], [, 25, ], [, c, ], Skłodowska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels,  commissioned by the, Society for the Encouragement of National Industry, ., [, 25, ], That same year, Pierre Curie, entered her life: it was their mutual interest in, natural sciences, that drew them together., [, 26, ], Pierre Curie was an instructor at, The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution, (ESPCI Paris)., [, 12, ], They were introduced by Polish physicist, Józef Wierusz-Kowalski,  who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space,  something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre could access., [, 12, ], [, 25, ], Though Curie did not have a large laboratory,  he was able to find some space for Skłodowska where she was able to begin work., [, 25, ], Pierre Curie, and Marie Skłodowska-Curie,  1895, Their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer,  and they began to develop feelings for one another., [, 12, ], [, 25, ], Eventually,  Pierre proposed marriage,  but at first Skłodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country. Curie,  however,  declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland,  even if it meant being reduced to teaching French., [, 12, ], Meanwhile,  for the 1894 summer break,  Skłodowska returned to Warsaw,  where she visited her family., [, 25, ], She was still labouring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland,  but she was denied a place at, Kraków University, because of, sexism in academia, ., [, 15, ], A letter from Pierre convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a PhD., [, 25, ], At Skłodowska's insistence,  Curie had written up his research on, magnetism, and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School., [, 25, ], A contemporary quip would call Skłodowska ""Pierre's biggest discovery""., [, 15, ], On 26 July 1895,  they were married in, Sceaux, ;, [, 27, ], neither wanted a religious service., [, 12, ], [, 25, ], Curie's dark blue outfit,  worn instead of a bridal gown,  would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit., [, 25, ], They shared two pastimes: long bicycle trips and journeys abroad,  which brought them even closer. In Pierre,  Marie had found a new love,  a partner,  and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend., [, 15, ], New elements, Pierre, and Marie Curie in the laboratory, c., 1904, In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen, discovered the existence of, X-rays,  though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood., [, 28, ], In 1896, Henri Becquerel, discovered that, uranium, salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power., [, 28, ], He demonstrated that this radiation,  unlike, phosphorescence,  did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries,  Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis., [, 12, ], [, 28, ], She used an innovative technique to investigate samples. Fifteen years earlier,  her husband and his brother had developed a version of the, electrometer,  a sensitive device for measuring electric charge., [, 28, ], Using her husband's electrometer,  she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique,  her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present., [, 28, ], She, hypothesized, that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of, molecules, but must come from the, atom, itself., [, 28, ], This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible., [, 28, ], [, 29, ], In 1897,  her daughter, Irène, was born. To support her family,  Curie began teaching at the, École Normale Supérieure, ., [, 23, ], The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to ESPCI., [, 23, ], The shed,  formerly a medical school dissecting room,  was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof., [, 30, ], They were unaware of the deleterious effects of, radiation exposure, attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. ESPCI did not sponsor her research,  but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments., [, 23, ], [, 30, ], [, 31, ], Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende, and, torbernite, (also known as chalcolite)., [, 30, ], Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself,  and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that,  if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct,  then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium., [, 30, ], [, 32, ], She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation,  and by 1898 she discovered that the element, thorium, was also radioactive., [, 28, ], Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her., [, 23, ], [, 30, ], The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own; no one helped her formulate it,  and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it. She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved., [, 33, ], Pierre, Irène,  and Marie Curie,  ca. 1902, She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her, priority, . Had not Becquerel,  two years earlier,  presented his discovery to the, Académie des Sciences, the day after he made it,  credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize),  would instead have gone to, Silvanus Thompson, . Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper,  giving a brief and simple account of her work,  was presented for her to the, Académie, on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann, ., [, 34, ], Even so,  just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel,  so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt, had published his own finding in Berlin., [, 35, ], At that time,  no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper,  describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: ""The fact is very remarkable,  and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium."" She later would recall how she felt ""a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible."", [, 35, ], On 14 April 1898,  the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore., [, 35, ], In July 1898,  Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named "", polonium, "",  in honour of her native Poland, [, 36, ], which would for another twenty years remain, partitioned among three empires, (, Russian, Austrian,  and, Prussian, )., [, 12, ], On 26 December 1898,  the Curies announced the existence of a second element,  which they named "", radium, "",  from the, Latin, word for ""ray""., [, 23, ], [, 30, ], [, 37, ], [, 38, ], In the course of their research,  they also coined the word "", radioactivity, ""., [, 12, ], Pierre and Marie Curie, c., 1903, To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt,  the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form., [, 30, ], Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element, bismuth,  and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore., [, 30, ], Radium,  however,  was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to, barium,  and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium,  but appreciable quantities,  uncontaminated with barium,  were still beyond reach., [, 39, ], The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential, crystallization, . From a tonne of pitchblende,  one-tenth of a gram of, radium chloride, was separated in 1902. In 1910,  she isolated pure radium metal., [, 30, ], [, 40, ], She never succeeded in isolating polonium,  which has a, half-life, of only 138 days., [, 30, ], Between 1898 and 1902,  the Curies published,  jointly or separately,  a total of 32 scientific papers,  including one that announced that,  when exposed to, radium,  diseased, tumour-forming, cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells., [, 41, ], In 1900,  Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris., [, 42, ], [, 43, ], In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death., [, 23, ], In June 1903,  supervised by, Gabriel Lippmann,  Curie was awarded her doctorate from the, University of Paris, ., [, 23, ], [, 44, ], That month the couple were invited to the, Royal Institution, in London to give a speech on radioactivity; being a woman,  she was prevented from speaking,  and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to., [, 45, ], Meanwhile,  a new industry began developing,  based on radium., [, 42, ], The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business., [, 30, ], [, 42, ], Nobel Prizes, 1903 Nobel Prize portrait, 1903 Nobel Prize diploma, Marie Curie's business card as professor at the Faculty of Sciences, In December 1903 the, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, awarded Pierre Curie,  Marie Curie,  and Henri Becquerel the, Nobel Prize in Physics, [, 46, ], ""in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the, radiation, phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."", [, 23, ], At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel,  but a committee member and advocate for women scientists,  Swedish mathematician, Magnus Gösta Mittag-Leffler,  alerted Pierre to the situation,  and after his complaint,  Marie's name was added to the nomination., [, 47, ], Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize., [, 23, ], Curie and her husband declined to go to, Stockholm, to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work,  and Pierre Curie,  who disliked public ceremonies,  was feeling increasingly ill., [, 45, ], [, 47, ], As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture,  the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905., [, 47, ], The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant., [, 47, ], Following the award of the Nobel Prize,  and galvanized by an offer from the, University of Geneva,  which offered Pierre Curie a position,  the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics,  although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory., [, 23, ], [, 42, ], [, 43, ], Upon Pierre Curie's complaint,  the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory,  but it would not be ready until 1906., [, 47, ], Caricature of Marie and Pierre Curie,  captioned ""Radium"",  in the London magazine, Vanity Fair,  December 1904, In December 1904,  Curie gave birth to their second daughter, Ève, ., [, 47, ], She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language,  and sent or took them on visits to Poland., [, 7, ], On 19 April 1906,  Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the, Rue Dauphine, in heavy rain,  he was struck by a, horse-drawn vehicle, and fell under its wheels,  fracturing his skull and killing him instantly., [, 23, ], [, 48, ], Curie was devastated by her husband's death., [, 49, ], On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie. She accepted it,  hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre., [, 49, ], [, 50, ], She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris., [, 23, ], Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris,  however. In her later years,  she headed the Radium Institute (, Institut du radium,  now, Curie Institute, Institut Curie, ),  a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the, Pasteur Institute, and the, University of Paris, ., [, 50, ], The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from, Pierre Paul Émile Roux,  director of the Pasteur Institute,  who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute., [, 23, ], [, 51, ], Only then,  with the threat of Curie leaving,  did the University of Paris relent,  and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute., [, 51, ], At the first, Solvay Conference, (1911),  Curie (seated,  second from right) confers with, Henri Poincaré, ; standing nearby are, Rutherford, (fourth from right), Einstein, (second from right),  and, Paul Langevin, (far right)., In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the, curie, ., [, 50, ], Nevertheless,  in 1911 the, French Academy of Sciences, failed,  by one, [, 23, ], or two votes, [, 52, ], to elect her to membership in the academy. Elected instead was, Édouard Branly,  an inventor who had helped, Guglielmo Marconi, develop the, wireless telegraph, ., [, 53, ], It was only over half a century later,  in 1962,  that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey,  became the first woman elected to membership in the academy., Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France,  the public's attitude tended toward, xenophobia, —the same that had led to the, Dreyfus affair, —which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish., [, 23, ], [, 52, ], During the French Academy of Sciences elections,  she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist., [, 52, ], Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour,  but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes., [, 23, ], In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist, Paul Langevin,  a former student of Pierre Curie's, [, 54, ], a married man who was estranged from his wife., [, 52, ], This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker., [, 55, ], When the scandal broke,  she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return,  she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge,  with her daughters,  in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo, ., [, 52, ], 1911 Nobel Prize diploma, International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights,  and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,  overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal,  honoured her a second time,  with the 1911, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, ., [, 15, ], This award was ""in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium,  by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."", [, 56, ], Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin,  the chair of the, Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius,  attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry,  citing her questionable moral standing. Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony,  because ""the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium"" and that ""there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life""., She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes,  and remains alone with, Linus Pauling, as Nobel laureates in two fields each. A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning,  headed by novelist, Henryk Sienkiewicz,  encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country., [, 15, ], Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute,  built in 1914,  where research was conducted in chemistry,  physics,  and medicine., [, 51, ], A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize,  she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912,  she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton, . She returned to her laboratory only in December,  after a break of about 14 months., [, 56, ], In 1912 the, Warsaw Scientific Society, offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined,  focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914,  and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie)., [, 51, ], [, 56, ], She was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris,  founded in 1914., [, 57, ], She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war,  as most researchers were drafted into the, French Army,  and it fully resumed its activities in 1919., [, 51, ], [, 56, ], [, 58, ], World War I, Curie in a mobile X-ray vehicle, c., 1915, During, World War I,  Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible., [, 59, ], She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons, [, 58, ], including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved., [, 60, ], [, 61, ], After a quick study of radiology,  anatomy,  and automotive mechanics,  she procured X-ray equipment,  vehicles,  and auxiliary generators,  and she developed mobile, radiography, units,  which came to be popularly known as, petites Curies, (""Little Curies"")., [, 58, ], She became the director of the, Red Cross, Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre,  operational by late 1914., [, 58, ], Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter, Irène,  Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war., [, 51, ], [, 58, ], Later,  she began training other women as aides., [, 62, ], In 1915,  Curie produced hollow needles containing ""radium emanation"",  a colourless,  radioactive gas given off by radium,  later identified as, radon,  to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply., [, 62, ], It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units., [, 19, ], [, 51, ], Busy with this work,  she carried out very little scientific research during that period., [, 51, ], In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort,  Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government., [, 58, ], Also,  promptly after the war started,  she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the, French National Bank, refused to accept them., [, 62, ], She did buy, war bonds,  using her Nobel Prize money., [, 62, ], She said:, I am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the scientific medals,  which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only,  I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost., [, 59, ], She was also an active member in committees of, Polonia in France, dedicated to the Polish cause., [, 63, ], After the war,  she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War, (1919)., [, 62, ], Postwar years, In 1920,  for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium,  the French government established a stipend for her; its previous recipient was, Louis Pasteur,  who had died in 1895., [, 51, ], In 1921,  she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium., Mrs. William Brown Meloney,  after interviewing Curie,  created a, Marie Curie Radium Fund, and raised money to buy radium,  publicising her trip., [, 51, ], [, 64, ], [, d, ], In 1921,  U.S. President, Warren G. Harding, received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States,  and the First Lady praised her as an example of a professional achiever who was also a supportive wife., [, 2, ], [, 66, ], Before the meeting,  recognising her growing fame abroad,  and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public,  the French government offered her a, Legion of Honour, award,  but she refused., [, 66, ], [, 67, ], In 1922 she became a fellow of the, French Academy of Medicine, ., [, 51, ], She also travelled to other countries,  appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium,  Brazil,  Spain,  and Czechoslovakia., [, 68, ], Marie and daughter, Irène,  1925, Led by Curie,  the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners,  including her daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, and her son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, ., [, 69, ], Eventually it became one of the world's four major radioactivity-research laboratories,  the others being the, Cavendish Laboratory,  with, Ernest Rutherford, ; the, Institute for Radium Research,  Vienna,  with, Stefan Meyer, ; and the, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry,  with, Otto Hahn, and, Lise Meitner, ., [, 69, ], [, 70, ], In August 1922 Marie Curie became a member of the, League of Nations, ' newly created, International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, ., [, 71, ], [, 10, ], She sat on the committee until 1934 and contributed to League of Nations' scientific coordination with other prominent researchers such as, Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz,  and, Henri Bergson, ., [, 72, ], In 1923 she wrote a biography of her late husband,  titled, Pierre Curie, ., [, 73, ], In 1925 she visited Poland to participate in a ceremony laying the foundations for Warsaw's, Radium Institute, ., [, 51, ], Her second American tour,  in 1929,  succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; the Institute opened in 1932,  with her sister Bronisława its director., [, 51, ], [, 66, ], These distractions from her scientific labours,  and the attendant publicity,  caused her much discomfort but provided resources for her work., [, 66, ], In 1930 she was elected to the, International Atomic Weights Committee,  on which she served until her death., [, 74, ], In 1931,  Curie was awarded the, Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh, ., [, 75, ], Death, 1935 statue,  facing the Radium Institute, Warsaw, Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934., [, 15, ], [, 76, ], A few months later,  on 4 July 1934,  she died aged 66 at the, Sancellemoz, sanatorium in, Passy,  Haute-Savoie,  from, aplastic anemia, believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation,  causing damage to her bone marrow., [, 51, ], [, 77, ], The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work,  which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed., [, 76, ], She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, [, 78, ], and she stored them in her desk drawer,  remarking on the, faint light, that the substances gave off in the dark., [, 79, ], Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the First World War., [, 62, ], When Curie's body was exhumed in 1995,  the French, Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements Ionisants, (, OPRI, ) ""concluded that she could not have been exposed to lethal levels of radium while she was alive"". They pointed out that radium poses a risk only if it is ingested,  and speculated that her illness was more likely to have been due to her use of radiography during the First World War., [, 80, ], She was interred at the cemetery in, Sceaux,  alongside her husband Pierre., [, 51, ], Sixty years later,  in 1995,  in honour of their achievements,  the remains of both were transferred to the Paris, Panthéon, . Their remains were sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity., [, 81, ], She became the second woman to be interred at the Panthéon (after, Sophie Berthelot, ) and the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthéon on her own merits., [, 10, ], Because of their levels of radioactive contamination,  her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle., [, 82, ], Even her cookbooks are highly radioactive., [, 83, ], Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes,  and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing., [, 83, ], In her last year,  she worked on a book, Radioactivity,  which was published posthumously in 1935., [, 76, ], Legacy, Marie Curie Monument in Lublin, The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries., [, 84, ], Cornell University, professor, L. Pearce Williams, observes:, The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation,  the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine,  the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked., [, 40, ], In addition to helping to overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry,  Curie's work has had a profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements,  she had to overcome barriers,  in both her native and her adoptive country,  that were placed in her way because she was a woman., [, 15, ], She was known for her honesty and moderate lifestyle., [, 23, ], [, 84, ], Having received a small scholarship in 1893,  she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep., [, 12, ], [, 31, ], She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends,  family,  students,  and research associates., [, 15, ], In an unusual decision,  Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific community could do research unhindered., [, 85, ], [, e, ], She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her., [, 84, ], She and her husband often refused awards and medals., [, 23, ], Albert Einstein, reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame., [, 15, ], Commemoration and cultural depictions, Bust of ""Maria Skłodowska-Curie"", CERN Museum, Switzerland,  2015, As one of the most famous scientists in history,  Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe,  even in the realm of, pop culture, ., [, 86, ], She also received many honorary degrees from universities across the world., [, 66, ], Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,  the first person to win two Nobel Prizes,  the only woman to win in two fields,  and the only person to win in, multiple sciences, ., [, 87, ], Awards and honours that she received include:, Nobel Prize in Physics, (1903,  with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel), [, 23, ], Davy Medal, (1903,  with Pierre), [, 68, ], [, 88, ], Matteucci Medal, (1904,  with Pierre), [, 88, ], Actonian Prize, (1907), [, 89, ], Elliott Cresson Medal, (1909), [, 90, ], Legion of Honour, (1909,  rejected), [, 91, ], Nobel Prize in Chemistry, (1911), [, 15, ], Civil Order of Alfonso XII, (1919), [, 92, ], Franklin Medal, of the, American Philosophical Society, (1921), [, 93, ], Order of the White Eagle, (2018,  posthumously), [, 94, ], Entities that have been named after Marie Curie include:, The, curie, (symbol Ci),  a unit of radioactivity,  is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre,  Marie,  or both)., [, 95, ], The element with atomic number 96 was named, curium, (symbol Cm)., [, 96, ], Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies:, curite, sklodowskite,  and, cuprosklodowskite, ., [, 97, ], The, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, fellowship program of the, European Union, for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country, [, 98, ], In 2007, a metro station in Paris, was renamed to honour both of the Curies., [, 97, ], The sole Polish nuclear reactor in operation,  the research, reactor Maria, [, 99, ], The, 7000 Curie, asteroid, [, 97, ], Marie Curie,  a registered charitable organisation in the United Kingdom, [, 100, ], The, IEEE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Award,  an international award presented for outstanding contributions to the field of nuclear and plasma sciences and engineering,  was established by the, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, in 2008., [, 101, ], The, Marie Curie Medal,  an annual, science award, established in 1996 and conferred by the, Polish Chemical Society, [, 102, ], The Marie Curie–Sklodowska Medal and Prize,  an annual award conferred by the London-based, Institute of Physics, for distinguished contributions to physics education, [, 103, ], Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, in, Lublin,  Poland, [, 104, ], Pierre and Marie Curie University, in Paris, Maria Skłodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, in Poland, École élémentaire Marie-Curie, in London,  Ontario,  Canada;, Curie Metropolitan High School, in Chicago,  United States;, Marie Curie High School, in Ho Chi Minh City,  Vietnam;, Lycée français Marie Curie de Zurich,  Switzerland; see, Lycée Marie Curie, for a list of other schools named after her, Rue Madame Curie, in Beirut,  Lebanon., Numerous biographies are devoted to her,  including:, Ève Curie, (Marie Curie's daughter), Madame Curie,  1938., Françoise Giroud, Marie Curie: A Life,  1987., Susan Quinn, Marie Curie: A Life,  1996., Barbara Goldsmith, Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie,  2005., [, 105, ], Lauren Redniss, Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie,  a Tale of Love and Fallout,  2011, [, 106, ], adapted into the 2019 British film., Marie Curie has been the subject of a number of films:, 1943:, Madame Curie,  a U.S. Oscar-nominated film by, Mervyn LeRoy, starring, Greer Garson, ., [, 73, ], 1997:, Les Palmes de M.

We were working in the interests of science. Radium was not to enrich anyone. Radium... belongs to all people.' As Eva Hemmungs Wirtén pointed out in, Making Marie Curie,  this claim takes on a different hue once you learn that,  under French law,  Curie was banned from taking out a patent in her own name,  so that any profits from her research would automatically have gone to her husband, Pierre, ."", Patricia Fara,  ""It leads to everything"" (review of Paul Sen, Einstein's Fridge: The Science of Fire,  Ice and the Universe,  William Collins,  April 2021, ISBN, 978 0 00 826279 2,  305 pp.), London Review of Books,  vol. 43,  no. 18 (23 September 2021),  pp. 20–21 (quotation,  p. 21)., References, ^, Jones,  Daniel, (2011).

He was educated by his father and in his early teens showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and geometry. When he was 16,  he earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematics., [, 3, ], [, clarification needed, ], By the age of 18,  he earned his license in physical sciences from the Faculty of Sciences at the, Sorbonne,  also known as the University of Paris., [, 3, ], [, 4, ], [, 5, ], He did not proceed immediately to a doctorate due to lack of money. Instead,  he worked as a laboratory instructor., [, 6, ], When Pierre Curie was preparing for his, Bachelor of Science, degree,  he worked in the laboratory of, Jean-Gustave Bourbouze, in the Faculty of Science., [, 7, ], In 1895,  he went on to receive his doctorate at the, University of Paris, ., [, 8, ], The submission material for his doctorate consisted of his research over, magnetism, ., [, 9, ], After obtaining his doctorate,  he became professor of physics and in 1900,  he became professor in the faculty of sciences., [, 10, ], Pierre and, Marie Skłodowska-Curie,  1895, In 1880,  Pierre and his older brother, Paul-Jacques, (1856–1941) demonstrated that an electric potential was generated when crystals were compressed,  i.e., piezoelectricity, ., [, 11, ], To aid this work they invented the piezoelectric quartz electrometer., [, 12, ], The following year they demonstrated the reverse effect: that crystals could be made to deform when subject to an electric field., [, 11, ], Almost all digital electronic circuits now rely on this in the form of, crystal oscillators, ., [, 13, ], In subsequent work on magnetism Pierre Curie defined the Curie scale., [, 14, ], This work also involved delicate equipment – balances,  electrometers,  etc., [, 15, ], Pierre Curie was introduced to, Maria Skłodowska, by their friend,  physicist, Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, ., [, 16, ], Curie took her into his laboratory as his student. His admiration for her grew when he realized that she would not inhibit his research., [, further explanation needed, ], He began to regard Skłodowska as his muse., [, 17, ], She refused his initial proposal,  but finally agreed to marry him on 26 July 1895., [, 6, ], [, 18, ], It would be a beautiful thing,  a thing I dare not hope if we could spend our life near each other,  hypnotized by our dreams: your patriotic dream,  our humanitarian dream,  and our scientific dream.

Variations on this equipment were commonly used by future workers in that area. Pierre Curie studied, ferromagnetism, paramagnetism,  and, diamagnetism, for his doctoral thesis,  and discovered the effect of temperature on paramagnetism which is now known as, Curie's law, . The material constant in Curie's law is known as the, Curie constant, . He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a, critical temperature, transition,  above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior. This is now known as the, Curie temperature, . The Curie temperature is used to study plate tectonics,  treat hypothermia,  measure caffeine,  and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields., [, 20, ], The, Curie, is a unit of measurement (3.7 × 10, 10, decays per second or 37, gigabecquerels, ) used to describe the intensity of a sample of radioactive material and was named after Marie and Pierre Curie by the Radiology Congress in 1910., [, 21, ], [, 22, ], Pierre Curie formulated what is now known as the, Curie Dissymmetry Principle, : a physical effect cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its efficient, cause, ., [, 23, ], [, 24, ], For example,  a random mixture of sand in zero gravity has no, dissymmetry, (it is, isotropic, ). Introduce a, gravitational field,  and there is a dissymmetry because of the direction of the field. Then the sand grains can 'self-sort' with the density increasing with depth. But this new arrangement,  with the directional arrangement of sand grains,  actually reflects the dissymmetry of the gravitational field that causes the separation., Pierre and, Marie Curie, in their laboratory, Curie worked with, his wife, in isolating, polonium, and, radium, . They were the first to use the term "", radioactivity, "",  and were pioneers in its study. Their work,  including Marie Curie's celebrated doctoral work,  made use of a sensitive piezoelectric, electrometer, constructed by Pierre and his brother Jacques Curie., [, 25, ], Pierre Curie's 26 December 1898 publication with his wife and M. G. Bémont, [, 26, ], for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the, ESPCI ParisTech, (officially the École supérieure de physique et de Chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris) in 2015., [, 27, ], [, 28, ], In 1903,  to honor the Curies' work,  the, Royal Society of London, invited Pierre to present their research., [, 29, ], Marie Curie was not permitted to give the lecture so, Lord Kelvin, sat beside her while Pierre spoke on their research. After this,  Lord Kelvin held a luncheon for Pierre., [, 29, ], While in London,  Pierre and Marie were awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society of London., [, 30, ], In the same year,  Pierre and Marie Curie,  as well as Henri Becquerel,  were awarded a Nobel Prize in physics for their research of radioactivity., [, 31, ], Curie and one of his students,  Albert Laborde,  made the first discovery of, nuclear energy,  by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles., [, 32, ], Curie also investigated the radiation emissions of radioactive substances,  and through the use of magnetic fields was able to show that some of the emissions were positively charged,  some were negative and some were neutral. These correspond to, alpha, beta, and, gamma radiation, ., [, 33, ], Spiritualism, [, edit, ], In the late nineteenth century,  Pierre Curie was investigating the mysteries of ordinary, magnetism, when he became aware of the, spiritualist, experiments of other European scientists,  such as, Charles Richet, and, Camille Flammarion, . Pierre Curie initially thought the systematic investigation into the paranormal could help with some unanswered questions about magnetism., [, 34, ], : 65, He wrote to Marie,  then his fiancée:  ""I must admit that those spiritual phenomena intensely interest me. I think they are questions that deal with physics."", [, 34, ], : 66, Pierre Curie's notebooks from this period show he read many books on spiritualism., [, 34, ], : 68, He did not attend séances such as those of, Eusapia Palladino, in Paris in June 1905, [, 34, ], : 238, as a mere spectator,  and his goal certainly was not to communicate with spirits. He saw the séances as scientific experiments,  tried to monitor different parameters,  and took detailed notes of every observation., [, 34, ], : 247, Despite studying spiritualism,  Curie was an, atheist, ., [, 35, ], Family, [, edit, ], Pierre Curie's grandfather,  Paul Curie (1799–1853),  a doctor of medicine,  was a committed Malthusian humanist and married Augustine Hofer,  daughter of Jean Hofer and great-granddaughter of Jean-Henri Dollfus,  great industrialists from, Mulhouse, in the second half of the 18th century and the first part of the 19th century., Through this paternal grandmother,  Pierre Curie is also a direct descendant of the Basel scientist and mathematician, Jean Bernoulli, (1667–1748),  as is, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes,  winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Physics., Pierre and Marie Curie's daughter, Irène,  and their son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie,  were also physicists involved in the study of, radioactivity,  and each also received Nobel prizes for their work., [, 36, ], The Curies' other daughter, Ève,  wrote a noted biography of her mother., [, 37, ], She was the only member of the Curie family to not become a physicist.  Ève married, Henry Richardson Labouisse Jr.,  who received a Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of, UNICEF, in 1965., [, 38, ], [, 39, ], Pierre and Marie Curie's granddaughter, Hélène Langevin-Joliot,  is a professor of nuclear physics at the, University of Paris,  and their grandson, Pierre Joliot,  who was named after Pierre Curie,  is a noted biochemist., [, 40, ], Tombs of, Marie, (above) and Pierre Curie at, Paris, ', Panthéon, Death, [, edit, ], Pierre Curie died in a street collision in Paris on 19 April 1906. Crossing the busy, Rue Dauphine, in the rain at the Quai de Conti,  he slipped and fell under a heavy horse-drawn cart. One of the wheels ran over his head,  fracturing his skull and killing him instantly., [, 41, ], Both the Curies experienced radium burns,  both accidentally and voluntarily, [, 42, ], and were exposed to extensive doses of radiation while conducting their research. They experienced radiation sickness and Marie Curie died from radiation-induced, aplastic anemia, in 1934. Even now,  all their papers from the 1890s,  even her cookbooks,  are too dangerous to touch. Their laboratory books are kept in special lead boxes and people who want to see them have to wear, protective clothing, ., [, 43, ], Most of these items can be found at, Bibliothèque nationale de France, ., [, 44, ], Had Pierre Curie not been killed in an accident as he was,  he would most likely have eventually died of the effects of radiation,  as did his wife,  their daughter, Irène,  and her husband, Frédéric Joliot, ., [, 45, ], [, 46, ], In April 1995,  Pierre and Marie Curie were moved from their original resting place,  a family cemetery,  and enshrined in the, crypt, of the, Panthéon in Paris, ., 1903 Nobel Prize diploma, Awards, [, edit, ], Nobel Prize in Physics,  with, Marie Curie, and, Henri Becquerel, (1903), [, 2, ], Davy Medal,  with, Marie Curie, (1903), [, 6, ], : 185, Matteucci Medal,  with, Marie Curie, (1904), [, 47, ], Elliott Cresson Medal, (1909) awarded posthumously during, Marie Curie, 's award ceremony, Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society (2015), [, 27, ], [, 28, ], References, [, edit, ], ^, Jones,  Daniel, (2011).

Jointly with her husband,  Joliot-Curie was awarded the, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in 1935 for their discovery of, induced radioactivity,  making them the, second-ever married couple, (, after her parents, ) to win the Nobel Prize,  while adding to the, Curie family legacy, of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date., [, 1, ], Her mother Marie Skłodowska–Curie and herself also form the only mother–daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes, [, 2, ], whilst Pierre and Irène Curie form the only father-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes by the same occasion,  whilst there are six father-son pairs who have won Nobel Prizes by comparison., [, 3, ], She was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government,  becoming, undersecretary, for Scientific Research under the, Popular Front, in 1936., [, 4, ], Both children of the Joliot-Curies, Hélène, and, Pierre,  are also prominent scientists., [, 5, ], In 1945,  she was one of the six commissioners of the new, French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, (CEA) created by de Gaulle and the, Provisional Government of the French Republic, . She died in Paris on 17 March 1956 from an, acute leukemia, linked to her exposure to, polonium, and, X-rays, ., Biography, [, edit, ], Early life and education, [, edit, ], Irène was born in Paris,  France,  on 12 September 1897 and was the first of, Marie, and, Pierre, 's two daughters. Her sister was, Ève,  born in 1904., [, 6, ], They lost their father early on in 1906 due to a horse-drawn wagon incident and Marie was left to raise them., [, 6, ], Education was important to Marie and Irène's education began at a school near the Paris Observatory., [, 7, ], This school was chosen because it had a more challenging curriculum than the school nearby the Curie's home., [, 7, ], In 1906,  it was obvious Irène was talented in mathematics and her mother chose to focus on that instead of public school., [, 7, ], Marie joined forces with a number of eminent French scholars,  including the prominent French physicist, Paul Langevin,  to form "", The Cooperative, "",  which included a private gathering of nine students that were children of the most distinguished academics in France. Each contributed to educating these children in their respective homes., [, 7, ], The curriculum of The Cooperative was varied and included not only the principles of science and scientific research but such diverse subjects as Chinese and sculpture and with great emphasis placed on self-expression and play., [, 8, ], Irène studied in this environment for about two years., [, 9, ], Irène and her sister, Ève, were sent to Poland to spend the summer with their Aunt Bronia (Marie's sister) when Irène was thirteen., [, 6, ], Irène's education was so rigorous that she still had a German and trigonometry lesson every day of that break., [, 6, ], Irène re-entered a more orthodox learning environment by going back to high school at the, Collège Sévigné, in central Paris until 1914. She then went onto the Faculty of Science at the, Sorbonne, to complete her, baccalaureate,  until 1916 when her studies were interrupted by, World War I, ., [, 9, ], World War I, [, edit, ], Irène and her mother and sister, Ève Curie, Irène took a nursing course during college to assist her mother,  Marie Curie,  in the field as her assistant., [, 10, ], She began her work as a nurse radiographer on the battlefield alongside her mother,  but after a few months she was left to work alone at a radiological facility in Belgium., [, 6, ], She taught doctors how to locate shrapnel in bodies using radiology and taught herself how to repair the equipment., [, 6, ], She moved throughout facilities and battlegrounds including two bombsites, Furnes, and, Ypres,  and, Amiens, ., [, 6, ], She received a military medal for her assistance in X-ray facilities in France and Belgium., [, 7, ], After the war,  Irène returned to the Sorbonne in Paris to complete her second baccalaureate degree in mathematics and physics in 1918., [, 10, ], Irène then went on to work as her mother's assistant,  teaching radiology at the, Radium Institute,  which had been built by her parents., [, 7, ], [, 11, ], Her doctoral thesis was concerned with the, alpha decay, of, polonium,  the element discovered by her parents (along with radium) and named after Marie's country of birth,  Poland. Irène became a Doctor of Science in 1925., [, 7, ], Research, [, edit, ], Irène and, Marie Curie, in 1925, As she neared the end of her doctorate in 1924,  Irène Curie was asked to teach the precision laboratory techniques required for radiochemical research to the young chemical engineer, Frédéric Joliot,  whom she would later wed. From 1928 Joliot-Curie and her husband Frédéric combined their research efforts on the study of atomic nuclei., [, 11, ], In 1932,  Joliot-Curie and her husband Frédéric had full access to Marie's polonium. Experiments were done using gamma rays to identify the, positron, ., [, 9, ], Though their experiments identified both the, positron, and the, neutron,  they failed to interpret the significance of the results and the discoveries were later claimed by, Carl David Anderson, and, James Chadwick, respectively., [, 11, ], These discoveries would have secured greatness indeed,  as together with, J. J. Thomson, 's discovery of the, electron, in 1897,  they finally replaced, John Dalton, 's, model, of atoms as solid spherical particles., [, citation needed, ], However,  in 1933,  Joliot-Curie and her husband were the first to calculate the accurate mass of the neutron., [, 11, ], The Joliot-Curies continued trying to get their name into the scientific community; in doing so they developed a new theory from an interesting experiment they conducted. During an experiment bombarding aluminium with alpha rays,  they discovered that only protons were detected. Based on the undetectable electron and positron pair,  they proposed that the protons changed into neutrons and positrons., [, 11, ], Later in October 1933,  this new theory was presented to the Seventh, Solvay Conference, . The Solvay Conferences consisted of prominent scientists in the physics and chemistry community., [, 11, ], Irene and her husband presented their theory and results to their fellow scientists,  but they received criticism of their finding from most of the 46 scientists attending., [, 11, ], However they were able to build on the controversial theory later on., [, citation needed, ], Curie, c., 1920s, In 1934,  the Joliot-Curies finally made the discovery that sealed their place in scientific history. Building on the work of Marie and Pierre Curie,  who had isolated naturally occurring radioactive elements,  the Joliot-Curies realised the alchemist's dream of turning one element into another: creating radioactive, nitrogen, from, boron,  radioactive isotopes of, phosphorus, from aluminium,  and, silicon, from, magnesium, . Irradiating the natural stable isotope of aluminium with, alpha particles, (i.e. helium nuclei) resulted in an, unstable isotope of phosphorus, :, 27, Al +, 4, He →, 30, P +, 1, n., [, 12, ], [, 13, ], [, 14, ], This phosporus isotope is not found in nature and decays emitting a positron. This discovery is formally known as, positron emission, or, beta decay,  where a proton in the radioactive nucleus changes to a neutron and releases a positron and an electron neutrino. By then,  the application of radioactive materials for use in medicine was growing and this discovery allowed radioactive materials to be created quickly,  cheaply,  and plentifully. The Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 brought with it fame and recognition from the scientific community and Joliot-Curie was awarded a professorship at the Faculty of Science., The work that Irène's laboratory pioneered,  research into radium nuclei,  would also help another group of physicists within Germany., Otto Hahn, and, Fritz Strassman, on 19 December 1938 bombarded uranium with neutrons,  but misinterpreted their findings., Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch would theoretically correct Hahn and Strassmann's findings,  and after replicating their experiment based on Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard's theory that he had confided to Meitner back in 1933,  confirmed on 13 January 1939 that Hahn and Strassmann had indeed observed, nuclear fission, : the splitting of the nucleus itself,  emitting vast amounts of energy. Lise Meitner's now-famous calculations actually disproved Irène's results and proved that nuclear fission was possible and replicable., [, 15, ], In 1948,  using work on nuclear fission,  the Joliot-Curies along with other scientists created the first French nuclear reactor., [, 11, ], [, 9, ], The Joliot-Curies were a part of the organization in charge of the project,  the Atomic Energy Commission, Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, (CEA). Irène was the commissioner of the CEA and Irène's husband,  Frédéric,  was the director of the CEA., [, 11, ], The reactor, Zoé, (Zéro énergie Oxyde et Eau lourde) used nuclear fission to generate five kilowatts of power., [, 11, ], [, 9, ], This was the beginning of nuclear energy as a source of power for France., Years of working so closely with radioactive materials finally caught up with Joliot-Curie and she was diagnosed with, leukemia, ., [, 16, ], [, 11, ], She had been accidentally exposed to, polonium, when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench in 1946., [, 17, ], Treatment with antibiotics and a series of operations relieved her suffering temporarily but her condition continued to deteriorate. Despite this,  Joliot-Curie continued to work and in 1955 drew up plans for new physics laboratories at the, Orsay Faculty of Sciences,  which is now a part of the, Paris-Saclay University,  south of Paris., [, citation needed, ], Political views, [, edit, ], The Joliot-Curies had become increasingly aware of the growth of the fascist movement., [, 16, ], [, 11, ], They opposed its ideals and joined the, Socialist Party, in 1934,  the, Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes, a year later,  and in 1936 they actively supported the, Republican faction, in the, Spanish Civil War, ., [, 16, ], In the same year,  Joliot-Curie was appointed Undersecretary of State for Scientific Research by the French government,  in which capacity she helped in founding the, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, ., [, 16, ], Frédéric and Irène visited Moscow for the two hundred and twentieth anniversary of the, Russian Academy of Science, and returned sympathizing with Russian colleagues.  Frédéric's close connection with the, Communist Party, caused Irène to later be detained on, Ellis Island, during her third trip to the US,  coming to speak in support of Spanish refugees,  at the, Joint Antifascist Refugee Committee, 's invitation., [, 18, ], The Joliot-Curies had continued Pierre and Marie's policy of publishing all of their work for the benefit of the global scientific community,  but afraid of the danger that might result should it be developed for military use,  they stopped: on 30 October 1939,  they placed all of their documentation on nuclear fission in the vaults of the French Academy of Sciences,  where it remained until 1949., [, 16, ], Joliot-Curie's political career continued after the war and she became a commissioner in the, Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, ., [, 16, ], However,  she still found time for scientific work and in 1946 became director of her mother's, Institut Curie, ., [, 16, ], [, 11, ], Joliot-Curie became actively involved in promoting women's education,  serving on the National Committee of the Union of French Women (, Comité National de l'Union des Femmes Françaises, ) and the, World Peace Council, . The Joliot-Curies were given memberships to the French, Légion d'honneur, ; Irène as an officer and Frédéric as a commander,  recognising his earlier work for the resistance., [, 16, ], [, 11, ], Personal life, [, edit, ], The Joliot-Curies in the 1940s, Irène and Frédéric hyphenated their surnames to Joliot-Curie after they married in 1926. The Joliot-Curies had two children, Hélène,  born eleven months after they were married,  and, Pierre,  born in 1932., [, 16, ], Between 1941 and 1943 during, World War II,  Joliot-Curie contracted, tuberculosis, and was forced to spend time convalescing in Switzerland., [, 16, ], Concern for her own health together with the anguish of her husband's being in the resistance against the German troops and her children in occupied France was hard to bear., [, 16, ], She did make several dangerous visits back to France,  enduring detention by German troops at the Swiss border on more than one occasion. Finally,  in 1944,  Joliot-Curie judged it too dangerous for her family to remain in France and she took her children back to Switzerland., [, 16, ], Later in September 1944,  after not hearing from Frédéric for months,  Irene and her children were finally able to rejoin him., [, 16, ], Irène fought through these struggles to advocate for her own personal views., [, 11, ], She was a passionate member of the feminist movement,  especially regarding the sciences,  and also advocated for peace. She continually applied to the, French Academy of Sciences,  an elite scientific organization,  knowing that she would be denied. She did so to draw attention to the fact they did not accept women in the organization., [, 11, ], Irène was also involved in many speaking functions such as the International Women's Day conference., [, 11, ], She also played a big role for the French contingent at the, World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace,  which promoted the World Peace movement., [, 11, ], In 1948,  during a strike involving coal miners,  Joliot-Curie reached out to Paris Newsletters to convince families to temporarily adopt the children of the coal miners during the strike. The Joliot-Curies adopted two girls during that time., [, 11, ], Death, [, edit, ], In 1956,  after a final convalescent period in the French Alps,  Joliot-Curie was admitted to the Curie Hospital in Paris,  where she died on 17 March at the age of 58 from leukemia,  possibly due to radiation from, polonium-210, ., [, 19, ], [, 20, ], Frédéric's health was also declining,  and he died in 1958 from liver disease,  which too was said to be the result of overexposure to radiation., [, 21, ], Joliot-Curie was an atheist and anti-war., [, 16, ], [, 22, ], [, 23, ], When the French government held a national funeral in her honor,  Irène's family asked to have the religious and military portions of the funeral omitted., [, 16, ], Frédéric was also given a national funeral by the French government., [, 16, ], Joliot-Curie's daughter, Hélène Langevin-Joliot,  went on to become a, nuclear physicist, and professor at the, University of Paris, . Joliot-Curie's son, Pierre Joliot,  went on to become a, biochemist, at, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, ., [, 16, ], Notable honours, [, edit, ], Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for the discovery of artificial radioactivity with Frédéric Joliot-Curie., Barnard Gold Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1940 with Frédéric Joliot-Curie., [, 24, ], Officer of the Legion of Honor., [, 14, ], Her name was added to the, Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations, erected in, Hamburg,  Germany., See also, [, edit, ], List of female Nobel laureates, Women in chemistry, Stefania Maracineanu, Timeline of women in science, Radioactive, (film), References, [, edit, ], ^, ""Nobel Prize facts: 'Family Nobel Laureates', "", .

The Institut du Radium had two sections. The Curie laboratory,  directed by Maria Skłodowska-Curie,  was dedicated to physics and chemistry research. The Pasteur laboratory,  directed by, Claudius Regaud,  was studying the biological and medical effects of, radioactivity, . After receiving a joint Nobel Prize with her husband Pierre in 1903,  Maria Skłodowska-Curie won a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. During World War One,  Maria Skłodowska-Curie used it to teach nurses about, radiology, ., Maria Skłodowska-Curie and Claudius Regaud established the Foundation Curie in 1920,  a public interest institution. The Foundation's purpose was to fund the Institut du Radium's activities and contribute to the development of its therapeutic component. A first hospital opened in 1922. At the clinic,  Regaud and his team developed innovative treatments combining surgery and, radiation therapy, to treat cancer. The Curie Foundation became a model for cancer centers around the world. Curie laboratory continued to play an important role in physics and chemistry research. In 1934,  Maria Skłodowska-Curie's daughter, Irène, and her son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, discovered, artificial radioactivity, . In 1935,  it was recognized with a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

[nʊˈbɛ̀lːˌpriːsn̩], ⓘ, ) are five separate prizes awarded to those who,  during the preceding year,  have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,  as established by the 1895 will of, Swedish, chemist,  engineer,  and industrialist, Alfred Nobel,  in the year before he died. Prizes were first awarded in 1901 by the, Nobel Foundation, ., [, 2, ], Nobel's will indicated that the awards should be granted in the fields of, Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature,  and, Peace, . A, sixth prize, for, Economic Sciences,  endowed by, Sweden, 's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank,  and first presented in 1969,  is also frequently included,  as it is also administered by the, Nobel Foundation, ., [, 2, ], [, 4, ], [, 5, ], The Nobel Prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields., [, 6, ], [, 7, ], The prize ceremonies take place annually. Each recipient,  known as a, laureate,  receives a, green gold, medal, plated with 24 karat gold,  a, diploma,  and a monetary award. As of 2023,  the Nobel Prize monetary award is 11, 000, 000, SEK,  amounting to ~$1, 035, 000., [, 3, ], A prize may not be shared among more than three individuals,  although the Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to organisations of more than three people., [, 8, ], Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously,  but if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it,  the prize is presented., [, 9, ], The Nobel Prizes,  beginning in 1901,  and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences,  beginning in 1969,  have been awarded 609 times to 975 people and 25 organisations. Five individuals and two organisations have received more than one Nobel Prize., [, 10, ], History, [, edit, ], Alfred Nobel, had the unpleasant surprise of reading his own obituary,  which was titled ""The Merchant of Death Is Dead"",  in a French newspaper., Alfred Nobel, was born on 21 October 1833 in, Stockholm,  Sweden,  into a family of engineers., [, 11, ], He was a, chemist, engineer,  and, inventor, . In 1894,  Nobel purchased the, Bofors, iron and steel mill,  which he made into a major, armaments, manufacturer, . Nobel also invented, ballistite, . This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives,  especially the British smokeless powder, cordite, . As a consequence of his patent claims,  Nobel was eventually involved in a, patent infringement, lawsuit, over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime,  with most of his wealth coming from his 355 inventions,  of which, dynamite, is the most famous., [, 12, ], There is a popular story about how,  in 1888,  Nobel was astonished to read his own, obituary,  titled ""The Merchant of Death Is Dead"",  in a French newspaper. It was Alfred's brother, Ludvig, who had died; the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his, will, ., [, 13, ], Historians have been unable to verify this story and some dismiss the story as a myth., [, 14, ], [, 15, ], On 10 December 1896,  Alfred Nobel died in his villa in, San Remo,  Italy,  from a, cerebral haemorrhage, . He was 63 years old., [, 16, ], Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died,  signing it at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895., [, 17, ], [, 18, ], To widespread astonishment,  Nobel's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the ""greatest benefit on mankind"" in, physics, chemistry, physiology, or, medicine, literature,  and, peace, ., [, 19, ], Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets,  31 million SEK (c. US$186 million,  €150 million in 2008),  to establish the five Nobel Prizes., [, 20, ], [, 21, ], Owing to skepticism surrounding the will,  it was not approved by the, Storting, in, Norway, until 26 April 1897., [, 22, ], The, executors, of the will, Ragnar Sohlman, and Rudolf Lilljequist,  formed the, Nobel Foundation, to take care of the fortune and to organise the awarding of prizes., [, 23, ], Nobel's instructions named a, Norwegian Nobel Committee, to award the, Peace Prize,  the members of which were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter,  the other prize-awarding organisations were designated. These were, Karolinska Institute, on 7 June,  the Swedish Academy on 9 June,  and the, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, on 11 June., [, 24, ], The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and,  in 1900,  the Nobel Foundation's newly created, statutes, were promulgated by, King Oscar II, ., [, 19, ], Nobel Foundation, [, edit, ], Formation of Foundation, [, edit, ], Main article:, Nobel Foundation, Alfred Nobel's, will,  which  stated that 94% of his total assets should be used to establish the Nobel Prizes, According to his will and testament read in Stockholm on 30 December 1896,  a foundation established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity. The Nobel Prize was funded by Alfred Nobel's personal fortune. According to the official sources,  Alfred Nobel bequeathed most of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation that now forms the economic base of the Nobel Prize., [, 25, ], The, Nobel Foundation, was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes., [, 26, ], In accordance with Nobel's, will,  the primary task of the foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left., Robert, and, Ludvig Nobel, were involved in the, oil business, in, Azerbaijan,  and according to Swedish, historian, E. Bargengren,  who accessed the, Nobel family, archive,  it was this ""decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from, Baku, that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established""., [, 27, ], Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the, Nobel laureates, ., [, 28, ], [, 29, ], In many ways,  the Nobel Foundation is similar to an, investment company,  in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is, exempt from all taxes, in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953)., [, 30, ], Since the 1980s,  the foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007,  the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion Swedish, kronor, (c. US$560 million)., [, 31, ], According to the statutes,  the foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens,  with its seat in Stockholm. The, chairman of the board, is appointed by the Swedish, King in Council,  with the other four members appointed by the, trustees, of the prize-awarding, institutions, . An, Executive director, is chosen from among the, board members,  a deputy director is appointed by the King in Council,  and two, deputies, are appointed by the, trustees, . However,  since 1995,  all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees,  and the executive director and the deputy director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board,  the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,  the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute,  the Swedish Academy,  and the, Norwegian Nobel Committee, ),  the trustees of these institutions,  and, auditors, ., [, 31, ], Foundation capital and cost, [, edit, ], The capital of the Nobel Foundation today is invested 50% in, shares,  20%, bonds, and 30% other, investments, (e.g., hedge funds, or, real estate, ). The distribution can vary by 10 percent., [, 32, ], At the beginning of 2008,  64% of the funds were invested mainly in American and European stocks,  20% in bonds,  plus 12% in real estate and hedge funds., [, 33, ], In 2011,  the total annual cost was approximately 120 million, kronor,  with 50 million kronor as the prize money. Further costs to pay institutions and persons engaged in giving the prizes were 27.4 million kronor. The events during the Nobel week in Stockholm and Oslo cost 20.2 million kronor. The administration,  Nobel, symposium,  and similar items had costs of 22.4 million kronor. The cost of the, Economic Sciences, prize of 16.5 Million kronor is paid by the, Sveriges Riksbank, ., [, 32, ], Inaugural Nobel prizes, [, edit, ], Wilhelm Röntgen,  who received the first, Nobel Prize in Physics, for his discovery of the, X-ray, Once the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place,  the, Nobel Committees, began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently,  they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions., The Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited, Wilhelm Röntgen, 's discovery of, X-rays, and, Philipp Lenard, 's work on, cathode rays, . The Academy of Sciences selected Röntgen for the prize., [, 34, ], [, 35, ], In the last decades of the 19th century,  many chemists had made significant contributions. Thus,  with the Chemistry Prize,  the academy ""was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize""., [, 36, ], The academy received 20 nominations,  eleven of them for, Jacobus van 't Hoff, ., [, 37, ], Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in, chemical thermodynamics, ., [, 38, ], [, 39, ], The Swedish Academy chose the poet, Sully Prudhomme, for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers,  artists,  and literary critics protested against this decision,  having expected, Leo Tolstoy, to be awarded., [, 40, ], Some,  including, Burton Feldman,  have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the academy members preferred, Victorian literature, and thus selected a Victorian poet., [, 41, ], The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist, Emil von Behring, . During the 1890s,  von Behring developed an, antitoxin, to treat, diphtheria,  which until then had been causing thousands of deaths each year., [, 42, ], [, 43, ], The first, Nobel Peace Prize, went to the Swiss, Jean Henri Dunant, for his role in founding the International, Red Cross Movement, and initiating the Geneva Convention,  and jointly given to French pacifist, Frédéric Passy,  founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization., Second World War, [, edit, ], In 1938 and 1939, Adolf Hitler, 's, Third Reich, forbade three laureates from Germany (, Richard Kuhn, Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt,  and, Gerhard Domagk, ) from accepting their prizes., [, 44, ], They were all later able to receive the diploma and medal., [, 45, ], Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War,  the prizes were awarded irregularly. In 1939,  the Peace Prize was not awarded. No prize was awarded in any category from 1940 to 1942,  due to the, occupation of Norway by Germany, . In the subsequent year,  all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace., [, 46, ], During the occupation of Norway,  three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the committee building in, Oslo, was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military,  which was not at war with Sweden., [, 47, ], These members kept the work of the committee going,  but did not award any prizes. In 1944,  the Nobel Foundation,  together with the three members in exile,  made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again., [, 44, ], Prize in Economic Sciences, [, edit, ], Main article:, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Map of Nobel laureates by country, In 1968,  Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honour of Alfred Nobel. The following year,  the, Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were, Jan Tinbergen, and, Ragnar Frisch, ""for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes""., [, 48, ], [, 49, ], The board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition,  it would allow no further new prizes., [, 50, ], Award process, [, edit, ], The award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes,  the main difference being who can make nominations for each of them., [, 51, ], The 2009 announcement of the laureates in, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, by, Gunnar Öquist,  permanent secretary of the, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, The 2009, Nobel Prize in Literature, announcement by, Peter Englund, in Swedish,  English,  and German, Nominations, [, edit, ], Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3, 000 individuals,  usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize,  inquiries are also sent to governments,  former Peace Prize laureates,  and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award., [, 51, ], [, 52, ], The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names., [, 53, ], The nominees are not publicly named,  nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize., [, 54, ], [, 55, ], Main article:, List of Nobel laureates § 50-year secrecy rule, Selection, [, edit, ], The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This,  along with the list of preliminary candidates,  is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions., [, 56, ], There are four awarding institutions for the six prizes awarded:, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, – Chemistry; Physics; Economics, Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, – Physiology / Medicine, Swedish Academy, – Literature, Norwegian Nobel Committee, – Peace, The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision,  which cannot be appealed,  is announced immediately after the vote., [, 57, ], A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize,  which can be awarded to institutions,  the awards can only be given to individuals., [, 58, ], The winners are announced by the awarding institutions during the first two weeks of October., Posthumous nominations, [, edit, ], Although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted,  individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to, Erik Axel Karlfeldt,  and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to, UN Secretary General, Dag Hammarskjöld, . Since 1974,  laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate, William Vickrey,  who in 1996 died after the prize (in, Economics, ) was announced but before it could be presented., [, 59, ], On 3 October 2011,  the laureates for the, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, were announced; however,  the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, Ralph M. Steinman,  had died three days earlier. The committee was debating about Steinman's prize,  since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously., [, 9, ], The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize ""was made in good faith"",  it would remain unchanged,  and the prize would be awarded., [, 60, ], Recognition time lag, [, edit, ], Nobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made ""during the preceding year"". Early on,  the awards usually recognised recent discoveries., [, 61, ], However,  some of those early discoveries were later discredited. For example, Johannes Fibiger, was awarded the 1926 Prize in, Physiology or Medicine, for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer., [, 62, ], To avoid repeating this embarrassment,  the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time., [, 63, ], [, 64, ], [, 65, ], According to Ralf Pettersson,  former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine,  ""the criterion 'the previous year' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident."", [, 64, ], The committee room of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement., [, 66, ], [, 67, ], The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example,  2008 laureate, Martti Ahtisaari, was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts., [, 68, ], [, 69, ], However,  they can also be awarded for specific recent events., [, 70, ], For instance, Kofi Annan, was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations., [, 71, ], Similarly, Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin,  and, Shimon Peres, received the 1994 award,  about a year after they successfully concluded the, Oslo Accords, ., [, 72, ], A, controversy, was caused by awarding the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize to, Barack Obama, during his first year as US president., [, 73, ], [, 74, ], Awards for physics,  chemistry,  and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted. Sometimes,  this takes decades – for example, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution., [, 75, ], [, 76, ], Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised. Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died., [, 77, ], [, 78, ], [, 79, ], Award ceremonies, [, edit, ], Right:, Giovanni Jona-Lasinio, presenting, Yoichiro Nambu, 's Nobel Lecture at, Aula Magna, in Stockholm in 2008; Left:, Barack Obama, after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo City Hall from Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman, Thorbjørn Jagland, in 2009, Except for the Peace Prize,  the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm,  Sweden,  at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December,  the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo,  Norway,  usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events., [, 80, ], [, 81, ], The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies are held at the, Stockholm Concert Hall,  with the Nobel banquet following immediately at, Stockholm City Hall, . The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the, Norwegian Nobel Institute, (1905–1946),  at the, auditorium, of the, University of Oslo, (1947–1989),  and at, Oslo City Hall, (1990–present)., [, 82, ], The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the, King of Sweden, . In Oslo,  the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the, King of Norway, and the, Norwegian royal family, ., [, 81, ], [, 83, ], At first,  King, Oscar II, did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners., [, 84, ], Nobel Banquet, [, edit, ], Main article:, Nobel Banquet, Table at the 2005, Nobel Banquet, in Stockholm, After the award ceremony in Sweden,  a banquet is held in the, Blue Hall, at the, Stockholm City Hall,  which is attended by the, Swedish Royal Family, and around 1, 300 guests. The, Nobel Peace Prize, banquet is held in Norway at the, Oslo Grand Hotel, after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate,  guests include the president of the, Storting,  on occasion the Swedish prime minister,  and,  since 2006,  the King and Queen of Norway. In total,  about 250 guests attend., Nobel lecture, [, edit, ], According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation,  each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize., [, 85, ], The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format., [, 86, ], These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet,  which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet),  but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize,  but some have happened even later. For example,  US President, Theodore Roosevelt, received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910,  after his term in office., [, 87, ], The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates., [, 88, ], Military cemeteries in every corner of the world are silent testimony to the failure of national leaders to sanctify human life., —, Yitzhak Rabin,  1994 Nobel Peace Prize lecture, [, 89, ], Prizes, [, edit, ], Medals, [, edit, ], Main article:, Nobel Prize medal, Fritz Haber, 's diploma is shown,  which he received for the development of a method to synthesise, ammonia, . Laureates receive a heavily decorated diploma together with a gold medal and prize money., The Nobel Foundation announced on 30 May 2012 that it had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Between 1902 and 2010,  the Nobel Prize medals were minted by, Myntverket, (the Swedish Mint),  Sweden's oldest company,  which ceased operations in 2011 after 107 years. In 2011,  the Mint of Norway,  located in Kongsberg,  made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation., [, 90, ], Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the, obverse, . The medals for physics,  chemistry,  physiology or medicine,  and literature have identical obverses,  showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize,  but with a slightly different design. For instance,  the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal., [, 91, ], The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design., [, 92, ], All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23, carat, gold. Since then,  they have been struck in 18 carat, green gold, plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold,  but averages about 175 grams (0.386 lb) for each medal. The diameter is 66 millimetres (2.6 in) and the thickness varies between 5.2 millimetres (0.20 in) and 2.4 millimetres (0.094 in)., [, 93, ], Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display,  Nobel medals are subject to medal theft., [, 94, ], [, 95, ], [, 96, ], During World War II,  the medals of German scientists, Max von Laue, and, James Franck, were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark,  Hungarian chemist (and Nobel laureate himself), George de Hevesy, dissolved them in, aqua regia, (nitro-hydrochloric acid),  to prevent confiscation by, Nazi Germany, and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war,  the gold was recovered from solution,  and the medals re-cast., [, 97, ], Diplomas, [, edit, ], Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden,  or in the case of the peace prize,  the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them., [, 91, ], The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas., [, 98, ], [, 99, ], Award money, [, edit, ], The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes,  in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded., [, 91, ], The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s,  when the prize money was 880, 000 SEK per prize (c. 2.6 million SEK altogether,  US$350, 000 today). In 2009,  the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million)., [, 100, ], [, 101, ], In June 2012,  it was lowered to 8 million SEK., [, 102, ], If two laureates share the prize in a category,  the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three,  the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally,  or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others., [, 103, ], [, 104, ], [, 105, ], It is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific,  cultural,  or humanitarian causes., [, 106, ], [, 107, ], Statistics, [, edit, ], Youngest person to receive a Nobel Prize:, Malala Yousafzai, ; at the age of 17,  received, Nobel Peace Prize, (2014)., Oldest person to receive a Nobel Prize:, John B.

Her husband, Pierre Curie,  shared the 1903 Physics prize with her., [, 118, ], Their daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie,  received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, . In addition,  the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, Henry Labouisse,  was the director of, UNICEF, when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 on that organisation's behalf., [, 119, ], Although no family matches the Curie family's record,  there have been several with two laureates. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to the husband-and-wife team of, Gerty Cori, and, Carl Ferdinand Cori, in 1947, [, 120, ], and to the husband-and-wife team of, May-Britt Moser, and, Edvard Moser, in 2014 (along with, John O'Keefe, )., [, 121, ], The Physics Prize in 1906 was won by, J.

Obama's award,  along with the previous Peace Prizes for, Jimmy Carter, and, Al Gore,  also prompted accusations of a, liberal, bias., [, 148, ], Aung San Suu Kyi, was awarded Peace Prize in 1993 however in 2015 when she came into power in, Myanmar,  she was criticized for being silent on human rights violation under her rule and especially over the, Rohingya genocide, and calls were made to strip of her from Nobel Peace Prize., [, 149, ], [, 150, ], Literature Prize, The award of the 2004 Literature Prize to, Elfriede Jelinek, drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlund, . Ahnlund resigned,  alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused ""irreparable damage to all progressive forces,  it has also confused the general view of literature as an art"". He alleged that Jelinek's works were ""a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure""., [, 151, ], [, 152, ], The 2009 Literature Prize to, Herta Müller, also generated criticism. According to, The Washington Post,  many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work., [, 153, ], This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric., [, 154, ], The 2019 Literature Prize to, Peter Handke, received heavy criticisms from various authors,  such as, Salman Rushdie, and, Hari Kunzru,  and was condemned by the governments of, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo,  and, Turkey,  due to his history of, Bosnian genocide denialism, and his support for, Slobodan Milošević, ., [, 155, ], [, 156, ], [, 157, ], Science prizes, In 1949,  the neurologist, António Egas Moniz, received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the, prefrontal leucotomy, . The previous year, Walter Freeman, had developed a, version of the procedure, which was faster and easier to carry out. Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure,  Freeman's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern, medical ethics, . Endorsed by such influential publications as, The New England Journal of Medicine,  leucotomy or ""lobotomy"" became so popular that about 5, 000 lobotomies were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz's receipt of the Prize., [, 158, ], [, 159, ], Overlooked achievements, [, edit, ], Mahatma Gandhi,  although nominated five times,  was never awarded a Nobel Peace Prize., James Joyce,  one of the controversial omissions of the, Nobel Prize in Literature, Although, Mahatma Gandhi,  an icon of, nonviolence, in the 20th century,  was nominated for the, Nobel Peace Prize, five times,  in 1937,  1938,  1939,  1947,  and a few days before he was assassinated on 30 January 1948,  he was never awarded the prize., [, 160, ], [, 161, ], [, 162, ], In 1948,  the year of, Gandhi's death,  the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided to make no award that year on the grounds that ""there was no suitable living candidate""., [, 160, ], [, 163, ], In 1989,  this omission was publicly regretted,  when the, 14th Dalai Lama, was awarded the Peace Prize,  the chairman of the committee said that it was ""in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi""., [, 164, ], Geir Lundestad,  2006 Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee,  said, The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace Prize. Whether the Nobel committee can do without Gandhi,  is the question., [, 165, ], [, 166, ], Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been overlooked. In 2009,  an article in, Foreign Policy, magazine identified seven people who ""never won the prize,  but should have"". The list consisted of Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Václav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Sari Nusseibeh, Corazon Aquino,  and, Liu Xiaobo, ., [, 162, ], Liu Xiaobo would go on to win the, 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, while imprisoned., In 1965,  UN Secretary General, U Thant, was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time,  Chairman, Gunnar Jahn, of the Nobel Peace prize committee,  lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to, UNICEF, . The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant,  for his work in defusing the, Cuban Missile Crisis,  ending the war in the Congo,  and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given,  with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant., [, 167, ], [, 168, ], The Literature Prize also has controversial omissions., Adam Kirsch, has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons. The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism., [, 169, ], [, 170, ], The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by, Peter Englund,  the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy,  as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors., [, 171, ], This tendency towards European authors still leaves many European writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize,  including, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, J. R. R. Tolkien, Émile Zola, Marcel Proust, Vladimir Nabokov, James Joyce, August Strindberg, Simon Vestdijk, Karel Čapek,  the, New World, 's, Jorge Luis Borges, Ezra Pound, John Updike, Arthur Miller, Mark Twain,  and Africa's, Chinua Achebe, ., [, 172, ], Candidates can receive multiple nominations the same year., Gaston Ramon, received a total of 155, [, 173, ], nominations in physiology or medicine from 1930 to 1953,  the last year with public nomination data for that award as of 2016, [update], . He died in 1963 without being awarded., Pierre Paul Émile Roux, received 115, [, 174, ], nominations in physiology or medicine,  and, Arnold Sommerfeld, received 84, [, 175, ], in physics. These are the three most nominated scientists without awards in the data published as of 2016, [update], ., [, 176, ], Otto Stern, received 79, [, 177, ], nominations in physics 1925–1943 before being awarded in 1943., [, 178, ], The strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial., [, 179, ], When a prize is awarded to recognise an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators,  one or more will miss out. For example,  in 2002,  the prize was awarded to, Koichi Tanaka, and, John Fenn, for the development of, mass spectrometry, in, protein, chemistry,  an award that did not recognise the achievements of, Franz Hillenkamp, and, Michael Karas, of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the, University of Frankfurt, ., [, 180, ], [, 181, ], According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics,  the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of, Carl Hagen, Gerald Guralnik,  and, Tom Kibble, published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the cosmos began,  but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to, Peter Higgs, and, François Englert,  who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject. All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion,  albeit from different angles. Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction,  or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years., [, 182, ], Similarly,  the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded. The Economics Prize was not awarded to, Fischer Black,  who died in 1995,  when his co-author, Myron Scholes, received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with, Robert C. Merton,  another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year,  the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role., Political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition., Lise Meitner, and, Fritz Strassmann,  who co-discovered nuclear fission along with, Otto Hahn,  may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the, Nazis, came to power., [, 183, ], The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognised until years later,  when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966, Enrico Fermi Award, ., Emphasis on discoveries over inventions, [, edit, ], Alfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded ""to those who,  during the preceding year,  shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind""., [, 184, ], He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given ""to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics"". Nobel did not emphasise discoveries,  but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries,  compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg,  in papers published in, Nature, and, Technoetic Arts,  have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society., [, 185, ], [, 186, ], Gender, [, edit, ], There have been a total of 57 women Nobel laureates compared to 873 men. Most female laureates received them in the peace and literature categories., Marie Curie, was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in 1903,  and the only woman to receive it twice., See also:, List of female Nobel laureates, and, List of female nominees for the Nobel Prize, In terms of the most prestigious awards in, STEM, fields,  only a small proportion have been awarded to women. Out of 210 laureates in Physics,  181 in Chemistry and 216 in Medicine between 1901 and 2018,  there were only three female laureates in physics,  five in chemistry and 12 in medicine., [, 187, ], [, 188, ], [, 189, ], [, 190, ], Factors proposed to contribute to the discrepancy between this and the roughly equal, human sex ratio, include biased nominations,  fewer women than men being active in the relevant fields,  Nobel Prizes typically being awarded decades after the research was done (reflecting a time when, gender bias, in the relevant fields was greater),  a greater delay in awarding Nobel Prizes for women's achievements making longevity a more important factor for women (one cannot be nominated for the Nobel Prize posthumously),  and a tendency to omit women from jointly awarded Nobel Prizes., [, 191, ], [, 192, ], [, 193, ], [, 194, ], [, 195, ], [, 196, ], Despite these factors,  Marie Curie is to date the only person awarded Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Physics in 1903,  Chemistry in 1911); she is one of only three people who have received two Nobel Prizes in sciences (see Multiple laureates below)., Malala Yousafzai, is the youngest person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. When she received it in 2014,  she was only 17 years old., [, 197, ], Status of the Economic Sciences Prize, [, edit, ], Peter Nobel, describes the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel as a ""false Nobel prize"" that dishonours his relative Alfred Nobel,  after whom the prize is named,  and considers economics to be a pseudoscience., [, 198, ], [, 199, ], Refusals and constraints, [, edit, ], Richard Kuhn,  who was forced to decline his, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Two laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre, was awarded the Literature Prize,  but refused,  stating,  ""A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution,  even if it takes place in the most honourable form."", [, 200, ], Lê Đức Thọ,  chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the, Paris Peace Accords,  declined,  stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam., [, 201, ], George Bernard Shaw, attempted to decline the prize money while accepting the 1925 Literature Prize; eventually it was agreed to use it to found the, Anglo-Swedish Literary Foundation, ., [, 202, ], During the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler, hindered, Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt,  and, Gerhard Domagk, from accepting their prizes. All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II., [, 203, ], [, 204, ], In 1958, Boris Pasternak, declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return,  the Swedish Academy refused his refusal,  saying ""this refusal,  of course,  in no way alters the validity of the award."", [, 201, ], The academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year,  holding it back until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf., [, 205, ], [, 206, ], Aung San Suu Kyi, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991,  but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in, Burma, ; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later,  in 2012., [, 207, ], Liu Xiaobo, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners,  and he was unable to accept the prize in his lifetime., Impact, [, edit, ], Cultural, [, edit, ], Being a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that is recognisable worldwide,  the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction. This includes films such as, The Prize, (1963), Nobel Son, (2007),  and, The Wife, (2017) about fictional Nobel laureates,  as well as fictionalised accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as, Nobel Chor,  a 2012 film based on the, theft of Rabindranath Tagore's prize, . It has also been depicted in television shows such as, The Big Bang Theory, ., [, 208, ], [, 209, ], The statue and memorial symbol, Planet of Alfred Nobel, was opened in, Alfred Nobel University, of Economics and Law in, Dnipro, Ukraine, in 2008. On the globe,  there are 802 Nobel laureates' reliefs made of a composite alloy obtained when disposing of military strategic missiles., [, 210, ], Despite the symbolism of intellectual achievement,  some recipients have embraced unsupported and, pseudoscientific, concepts,  including various, health benefits of vitamin C, and other dietary supplements, homeopathy, HIV/AIDS denialism,  and various claims about, race and intelligence, ., [, 211, ], This is sometimes referred to as, Nobel disease, ., International relationship, [, edit, ], This section is empty., You can help by, adding to it, ., (, May 2024, ), Science advancement, [, edit, ], This section is empty., You can help by, adding to it, ., (, May 2024, ), See also, [, edit, ], History of Science portal, Norway portal, Sweden portal, List of Nobel laureates, List of female Nobel laureates, List of Nobel laureates by country, List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry, List of Nobel laureates in Literature, List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, List of Nobel laureates in Physics, List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine, List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics, Nobel Prize medal, Fields Medal, – Mathematics award, Abel Prize, – Norwegian international mathematics prize, Ig Nobel Prize, – Annually awarded parody of the Nobel Prize, Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field, Lists of science and technology awards, Nobel Conference, – Academic conference held annually at Gustavus Adolphus College, Nobel Library, – library in Stockholm,  Sweden, Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback, Nobel Prize Museum, – Museum about Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prize, Nobel Prize effect, – Observation about the adverse effects of receiving the Nobel Prize, References, [, edit, ], ^, ""The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel"", ., Nobel Prize, ., Archived, from the original on 5 December 2018, .

and, atomic number, 84. A rare and highly, radioactive, metal, (although sometimes classified as a, metalloid, ) with no stable, isotopes,  polonium is a, chalcogen, and chemically similar to, selenium, and, tellurium,  though its metallic character resembles that of its, horizontal neighbors, in the, periodic table, :, thallium, lead,  and, bismuth, . Due to the short, half-life, of all its isotopes,  its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting, polonium-210, (with a half-life of 138 days) in, uranium, ores,  as it is the, penultimate daughter, of natural, uranium-238, . Though longer-lived isotopes exist,  such as the 124 years half-life of polonium-209,  they are much more difficult to produce. Today,  polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the, neutron irradiation, of, bismuth, . Due to its intense radioactivity,  which results in the, radiolysis, of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating,  its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only., Polonium was discovered on July 18,  1898 by, Marie Skłodowska-Curie, and, Pierre Curie,  when it was extracted from the uranium ore, pitchblende, [, 3, ], and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: it was the first element to be discovered in this way., [, 4, ], Polonium was named after Marie Skłodowska Curie's homeland of, Poland, . Polonium has few applications,  and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in, space probes, antistatic devices,  sources of, neutrons, and, alpha particles,  and, poison, e.g., poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, . It is extremely dangerous to humans., Characteristics, [, edit, ], 210, Po is an, alpha emitter, that has a half-life of 138.4 days; it decays directly to its stable, daughter isotope, 206, Pb, . A milligram (5, curies, ) of, 210, Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5 grams of, 226, Ra, [, 5, ], which means it is 5, 000 times more radioactive than radium. A few, curies, (1 curie equals 37, gigabecquerels,  1 Ci = 37 GBq) of, 210, Po emit a blue glow which is caused by, ionisation, of the surrounding air., About one in 100, 000 alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a, gamma ray, with a maximum energy of 803 keV., [, 6, ], [, 7, ], Solid state form, [, edit, ], The alpha form of solid polonium, Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two, metallic, allotropes, . The alpha form is the only known example of a, simple cubic, crystal structure in a single atom basis at, STP, (, space group, Pm, 3, m,  no. 221). The unit cell has an edge length of 335.2, picometers, ; the beta form is, rhombohedral, ., [, 8, ], [, 9, ], [, 10, ], The structure of polonium has been characterized by, X-ray, diffraction, [, 11, ], [, 12, ], and, electron diffraction, ., [, 13, ], 210, Po has the ability, to become airborne with ease, : if a sample is heated in air to 55 °C (131 °F),  50% of it is vaporized in 45 hours to form, diatomic, Po, 2, molecules,  even though the melting point of polonium is 254 °C (489 °F) and its boiling point is 962 °C (1, 764 °F)., [, 14, ], [, 15, ], [, 1, ], More than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this; one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are, spalled off, by the alpha decay., [, 16, ], Chemistry, [, edit, ], The chemistry of polonium is similar to that of, tellurium,  although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor, bismuth, due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute, acids, but is only slightly, soluble, in, alkalis, . Polonium, solutions, are first colored in pink by the Po, 2+, ions,  but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po, 2+, into Po, 4+, . As polonium also emits alpha-particles after disintegration so this process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by, glassware, due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result,  polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed., [, 17, ], [, 18, ], At pH about 1,  polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as, oxalic acid, citric acid,  and, tartaric acid, ., [, 19, ], Compounds, [, edit, ], Polonium has no common compounds,  and almost all of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known., [, 20, ], The most stable class of polonium compounds are, polonides,  which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements., Na, 2, Po, has the, antifluorite, structure,  the polonides of, Ca, Ba, Hg,  Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo, and, CdPo, have the, wurtzite, and, MgPo, the, nickel arsenide, structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600 °C,  except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300 °C and the, lanthanide, polonides,  which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000 °C. For example,  the polonide of, praseodymium, (PrPo) melts at 1250 °C,  and that of, thulium, (TmPo) melts at 2200 °C., [, 21, ], PbPo, is one of the very few naturally occurring polonium compounds,  as polonium, alpha decays, to form, lead, ., [, 22, ], Polonium hydride, (, PoH, 2, ) is a volatile liquid at room temperature prone to dissociation; it is thermally unstable., [, 21, ], Water, is the only other known, hydrogen chalcogenide, which is a liquid at room temperature; however,  this is due to hydrogen bonding. The three oxides, PoO, PoO, 2, and, PoO, 3,  are the products of oxidation of polonium., [, 23, ], Halides, of the structure PoX, 2,  PoX, 4, and PoF, 6, are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides,  i.e.,  PoCl, X, in HCl,  PoBr, X, in HBr and PoI, 4, in HI., [, 24, ], Polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl, 4, with SO, 2, and with PoBr, 4, with H, 2, S at room temperature. Tetrahalides can be obtained by reacting polonium dioxide with HCl,  HBr or HI., [, 25, ], Other polonium compounds include the, polonite, potassium polonite, ; various, polonate, solutions; and the, acetate, bromate, carbonate, citrate, chromate,  cyanide, formate, (II), or, (IV), hydroxide, nitrate, selenate, selenite,  monosulfide, sulfate, disulfate, or, sulfite, salts., [, 24, ], [, 26, ], A limited, organopolonium chemistry, is known,  mostly restricted to dialkyl and diaryl polonides (R, 2, Po),  triarylpolonium halides (Ar, 3, PoX),  and diarylpolonium dihalides (Ar, 2, PoX, 2, )., [, 27, ], [, 28, ], Polonium also forms soluble compounds with some, ligands,  such as, 2, 3-butanediol, and, thiourea, ., [, 27, ], Polonium compounds, [, 25, ], [, 29, ], Formula, Color, m.p., (°C), Sublimation, temp.

The longer-lived, 209, Po (half-life 124 years,  longest-lived of all polonium isotopes), [, 2, ], and, 208, Po (half-life 2.9 years) can be made through the alpha,  proton,  or deuteron bombardment of, lead, or bismuth in a, cyclotron, ., [, 34, ], History, [, edit, ], Tentatively called "", radium F, "",  polonium was discovered by, Marie, and Pierre Curie in July 1898, [, 35, ], [, 36, ], and was named after Marie Curie's native land of, Poland, (, Latin, :, Polonia, )., [, 37, ], [, 38, ], Poland at the time was under, Russian, German,  and, Austro-Hungarian, partition,  and did not exist as an independent country. It was Curie's hope that naming the element after her native land would publicize its lack of independence. Polonium may be the first element named to highlight a political controversy., [, 39, ], This element was the first one discovered by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of, pitchblende, radioactivity, . Pitchblende,  after removal of the radioactive elements, uranium, and, thorium,  was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined. This spurred the Curies to search for additional radioactive elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898,  and five months later,  also isolated, radium, ., [, 17, ], [, 35, ], [, 40, ], German scientist, Willy Marckwald, successfully isolated 3 milligrams of polonium in 1902,  though at the time he believed it was a new element,  which he dubbed ""radio-tellurium"",  and it was not until 1905 that it was demonstrated to be the same as polonium., [, 41, ], [, 42, ], In the United States,  polonium was produced as part of the, Manhattan Project, 's, Dayton Project, during, World War II, . Polonium and, beryllium, were the key ingredients of the ', Urchin, ' initiator at the center of the bomb's spherical, pit, ., [, 43, ], 'Urchin' initiated the, nuclear chain reaction, at the moment of, prompt-criticality, to ensure that the weapon did not, fizzle, . 'Urchin' was used in early U.S. weapons; subsequent U.S. weapons utilized a pulse neutron generator for the same purpose., [, 43, ], Much of the basic physics of polonium was, classified, until after the war. The fact that a polonium-beryllium (Po-Be) initiator was used in the gun-type nuclear weapons was classified until the 1960s., [, 44, ], The, Atomic Energy Commission, and the, Manhattan Project, funded, human experiments, using polonium on five people at the, University of Rochester, between 1943 and 1947. The people were administered between 9 and 22, microcuries, (330 and 810, kBq, ) of polonium to study its, excretion, ., [, 45, ], [, 46, ], [, 47, ], Occurrence and production, [, edit, ], Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short, half-lives, of all its isotopes. Nine isotopes,  from 210 to 218 inclusive,  occur in, traces, as, decay products, :, 210, Po, 214, Po,  and, 218, Po occur in the, decay chain, of, 238, U, ;, 211, Po and, 215, Po occur in the decay chain of, 235, U, ;, 212, Po and, 216, Po occur in the decay chain of, 232, Th, ; and, 213, Po and, 217, Po occur in the decay chain of, 237, Np, . (No primordial, 237, Np survives,  but traces of it are continuously regenerated through (n, 2n) knockout reactions in natural, 238, U.), [, 48, ], Of these, 210, Po is the only isotope with a half-life longer than 3 minutes., [, 49, ], Polonium can be found in, uranium, ores at about 0.1 mg per, metric ton, (1 part in 10, 10, ), [, 50, ], [, 51, ], which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in, tobacco smoke, from tobacco leaves grown with, phosphate, fertilizers., [, 52, ], [, 53, ], [, 54, ], Because it is present in small concentrations,  isolation of polonium from natural sources is a tedious process. The largest batch of the element ever extracted,  performed in the first half of the 20th century,  contained only 40 Ci (1.5 TBq) (9 mg) of, polonium-210, and was obtained by processing 37 tonnes of residues from radium production., [, 55, ], Polonium is now usually obtained by irradiating bismuth with high-energy neutrons or protons., [, 17, ], [, 56, ], In 1934,  an experiment showed that when natural, 209, Bi, is bombarded with, neutrons, 210, Bi is created,  which then decays to, 210, Po via beta-minus decay. By irradiating certain bismuth salts containing light element nuclei such as beryllium,  a cascading (α, n) reaction can also be induced to produce, 210, Po in large quantities., [, 57, ], The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques., [, 58, ], Polonium may now be made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in, nuclear reactors, ., [, 56, ], Only about 100 grams are produced each year,  practically all of it in Russia,  making polonium exceedingly rare., [, 59, ], [, 60, ], This process can cause problems in, lead-bismuth, based, liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors, such as those used in the, Soviet Navy, 's, K-27, . Measures must be taken in these reactors to deal with the unwanted possibility of, 210, Po being released from the coolant., [, 61, ], [, 62, ], The longer-lived isotopes of polonium, 208, Po and, 209, Po,  can be formed by, proton, or, deuteron, bombardment of bismuth using a, cyclotron, . Other more neutron-deficient and more unstable isotopes can be formed by the irradiation of platinum with, carbon, nuclei., [, 63, ], Applications, [, edit, ], Polonium-based sources of alpha particles were produced in the former, Soviet Union, ., [, 64, ], Such sources were applied for measuring the thickness of industrial coatings via attenuation of alpha radiation., [, 65, ], Because of intense alpha radiation,  a one-gram sample of, 210, Po will spontaneously heat up to above 500 °C (932 °F) generating about 140 watts of power. Therefore, 210, Po is used as an atomic heat source to power, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, via, thermoelectric, materials., [, 5, ], [, 17, ], [, 66, ], [, 67, ], For example, 210, Po heat sources were used in the, Lunokhod, 1 (1970) and Lunokhod 2 (1973), Moon, rovers to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights,  as well as the, Kosmos 84, and 90 satellites (1965)., [, 64, ], [, 68, ], The alpha particles emitted by polonium can be converted to neutrons using beryllium oxide,  at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles., [, 66, ], Po-BeO mixtures are used as passive, neutron sources, with a, gamma-ray, -to-, neutron, production ratio of 1.13 ± 0.05,  lower than for, nuclear fission, -based neutron sources., [, 69, ], Examples of Po-BeO mixtures or, alloys, used as neutron sources are a, neutron trigger or initiator, for, nuclear weapons, [, 17, ], [, 70, ], and for inspections of oil wells. About 1500 sources of this type,  with an individual activity of 1, 850 Ci (68 TBq),  had been used annually in the Soviet Union., [, 71, ], Polonium was also part of brushes or more complex tools that eliminate static charges in photographic plates, textile, mills,  paper rolls,  sheet plastics,  and on substrates (such as automotive) prior to the application of coatings., [, 72, ], Alpha particles emitted by polonium ionize air molecules that neutralize charges on the nearby surfaces., [, 73, ], [, 74, ], Some anti-static brushes contain up to 500 microcuries (20 MBq) of, 210, Po as a source of charged particles for neutralizing static electricity., [, 75, ], In the US,  devices with no more than 500 μCi (19 MBq) of (sealed), 210, Po per unit can be bought in any amount under a ""general license"", [, 76, ], which means that a buyer need not be registered by any authorities. Polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half-life; it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous, beta particle, sources., [, 5, ], Tiny amounts of, 210, Po are sometimes used in the laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically of the order of 4–40 kBq (0.11–1.08 μCi),  in the form of sealed sources,  with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of, 210, Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as ""needle sources"" for laboratory experimentation,  and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold,  which allows the, alpha radiation, (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard., [, citation needed, ], Polonium, spark plugs, were marketed by, Firestone, from 1940 to 1953. While the amount of radiation from the plugs was minuscule and not a threat to the consumer,  the benefits of such plugs quickly diminished after approximately a month because of polonium's short half-life and because buildup on the conductors would block the radiation that improved engine performance. (The premise behind the polonium spark plug,  as well as, Alfred Matthew Hubbard, 's prototype, radium, plug that preceded it,  was that the radiation would improve ionization of the fuel in the cylinder and thus allow the motor to fire more quickly and efficiently.), [, 77, ], [, 78, ], Biology and toxicity, [, edit, ], Overview, [, edit, ], Polonium can be hazardous and has no biological role., [, 17, ], By mass,  polonium-210 is around 250, 000 times more toxic than, hydrogen cyanide, (the, LD, 50, for, 210, Po is less than 1, microgram, for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250, milligrams, for hydrogen cyanide, [, 79, ], ). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter),  which makes it difficult to handle safely. Even in, microgram, amounts,  handling, 210, Po is extremely dangerous,  requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha, glove box, equipped with high-performance filters),  adequate monitoring,  and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested,  inhaled,  or absorbed,  although they do not penetrate the, epidermis, and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body and do not come near the eyes,  which are living tissue. Wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous, diffusion, of polonium directly through the, skin, . Polonium delivered in concentrated, nitric acid, can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., latex gloves, ) or the acid may damage the gloves., [, 80, ], Polonium does not have toxic chemical properties., [, 81, ], It has been reported that some, microbes, can, methylate, polonium by the action of, methylcobalamin, ., [, 82, ], [, 83, ], This is similar to the way in which, mercury, selenium,  and, tellurium, are methylated in living things to create, organometallic, compounds. Studies investigating the metabolism of polonium-210 in rats have shown that only 0.002 to 0.009% of polonium-210 ingested is excreted as volatile polonium-210., [, 84, ], Acute effects, [, edit, ], The, median lethal dose, (LD, 50, ) for acute radiation exposure is about 4.5, Sv, ., [, 85, ], The, committed effective dose equivalent, 210, Po is 0.51 μSv/, Bq, if ingested,  and 2.5 μSv/Bq if inhaled., [, 86, ], A fatal 4.5 Sv dose can be caused by ingesting 8.8 MBq (240 μCi),  about 50, nanograms, (ng),  or inhaling 1.8 MBq (49 μCi),  about 10 ng. One gram of, 210, Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people,  of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of, 210, Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the, biological half-life, of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days, [, 87, ], ) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a, median lethal dose, of, 210, Po is 15 megabecquerels (0.41 mCi),  or 0.089 micrograms (μg),  still an extremely small amount., [, 88, ], [, 89, ], For comparison,  one grain of, table salt, is about 0.06 mg = 60 μg., [, 90, ], Long term (chronic) effects, [, edit, ], In addition to the acute effects,  radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv., [, 85, ], The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a, radon, daughter in indoor air; the isotopes, 214, Po and, 218, Po are thought to cause the majority, [, 91, ], of the estimated 15, 000–22, 000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon., [, 92, ], Tobacco smoking, causes additional exposure to polonium., [, 93, ], Regulatory exposure limits and handling, [, edit, ], The maximum allowable body burden for ingested, 210, Po is only 1.1 kBq (30 nCi),  which is equivalent to a particle massing only 6.8 picograms., [, 94, ], The maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne, 210, Po is about 10 Bq/m, 3, (, 3, ×, 10, −10, μCi/cm, 3, )., [, 95, ], The target organs for polonium in humans are the, spleen, and, liver, ., [, 96, ], As the spleen (150 g) and the liver (1.3 to 3 kg) are much smaller than the rest of the body,  if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs,  it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered (on average) by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body,  in the same way as, caesium, or, tritium, (as T, 2, O)., [, 97, ], [, 98, ], 210, Po is widely used in industry,  and readily available with little regulation or restriction., [, 99, ], [, 100, ], In the US,  a tracking system run by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was implemented in 2007 to register purchases of more than 16 curies (590 GBq) of polonium-210 (enough to make up 5, 000 lethal doses). The IAEA ""is said to be considering tighter regulations ... There is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of 10,  to 1.6 curies (59 GBq)."", [, 99, ], As of 2013,  this is still the only alpha emitting byproduct material available,  as a NRC Exempt Quantity,  which may be held without a radioactive material license., [, citation needed, ], Polonium and its compounds must be handled with caution inside special alpha, glove boxes,  equipped with, HEPA, filters and continuously maintained under depression to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of, natural rubber, (, latex, ) do not properly withstand chemical attacks,  a.o. by concentrated, nitric acid, (e.g.,  6 M, HNO, 3, ), commonly used to keep polonium in, solution, while minimizing its, sorption, onto glass. They do not provide sufficient protection against the contamination from polonium (, diffusion, of, 210, Po solution through the intact latex membrane,  or worse,  direct contact through tiny holes and cracks produced when the latex begins to suffer degradation by acids or UV from ambient light); additional surgical gloves are necessary (inside the glovebox to protect the main gloves when handling strong acids and bases,  and also from outside to protect the operator hands against, 210, Po contamination from diffusion,  or direct contact through glove defects). Chemically more resistant,  and also denser, neoprene, and butyl gloves shield alpha particles emitted by polonium better than natural rubber., [, 101, ], The use of natural rubber gloves is not recommended for handling, 210, Po solutions., Cases of poisoning, [, edit, ], Despite the element's highly hazardous properties,  circumstances in which polonium poisoning can occur are rare. Its extreme scarcity in nature, [, 102, ], the short half-lives of all its isotopes,  the specialised facilities and equipment needed to obtain any significant quantity,  and safety precautions against laboratory accidents all make harmful exposure events unlikely. As such,  only a handful of cases of radiation poisoning specifically attributable to polonium exposure have been confirmed., [, 103, ], 20th century, [, edit, ], In response to concerns about the risks of occupational polonium exposure,  quantities of, 210, Po were administered to five human volunteers at the University of Rochester from 1944 to 1947,  in order to study its biological behaviour. These studies were funded by the, Manhattan Project, and the AEC. Four men and a woman participated,  all suffering from terminal cancers,  and ranged in age from their early thirties to early forties; all were chosen because experimenters wanted subjects who had not been exposed to polonium either through work or accident., [, 104, ], 210, Po was injected into four hospitalised patients,  and orally given to a fifth. None of the administered doses (all ranging from 0.17 to 0.30 μ, Ci, kg, −1, ) approached fatal quantities., [, 105, ], [, 104, ], The first documented death directly resulting from polonium poisoning occurred in the, Soviet Union,  on 10 July 1954., [, 106, ], [, 107, ], An unidentified 41-year-old man presented for medical treatment on 29 June,  with severe vomiting and fever; the previous day,  he had been working for five hours in an area in which,  unknown to him,  a capsule containing, 210, Po had depressurised and begun to disperse in aerosol form. Over this period,  his total intake of airborne, 210, Po was estimated at 0.11 GBq (almost 25 times the estimated LD, 50, by inhalation of 4.5 MBq). Despite treatment,  his condition continued to worsen and he died 13 days after the exposure event., [, 106, ], From 1955 to 1957 the, Windscale Piles, had been releasing polonium-210. The, Windscale fire, brought the need for testing of the land downwind for radioactive material contamination,  and this is how it was found. An estimate of 8.8 terabecquerels (240 Ci) of polonium-210 has been made., It has also been suggested that, Irène Joliot-Curie, 's 1956 death from leukaemia was owed to the radiation effects of polonium. She was accidentally exposed in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench., [, 108, ], As well,  several deaths in Israel during 1957–1969 have been alleged to have resulted from, 210, Po exposure., [, 109, ], A leak was discovered at a, Weizmann Institute, laboratory in 1957. Traces of, 210, Po were found on the hands of Professor Dror Sadeh,  a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm,  but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh,  one of his students,  and two colleagues died from various, cancers, over the subsequent few years. The issue was investigated secretly,  but there was never any formal admission of a connection between the leak and the deaths., [, 110, ], The, Church Rock uranium mill spill, July 16,  1979 is reported to have released, polonium-210, . The report states animals had higher concentrations of lead-210,  polonium-210 and radium-226 than the tissues from control animals., [, 111, ], 21st century, [, edit, ], Further information:, Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, and, Cause of Yasser Arafat's death, The cause of the, 2006 death, of, Alexander Litvinenko,  a former Russian, FSB, agent who had defected to the United Kingdom in 2001,  was identified to be poisoning with a lethal dose of, 210, Po;, [, 112, ], [, 113, ], it was subsequently determined that the, 210, Po had probably been deliberately administered to him by two Russian ex-security agents, Andrey Lugovoy, and, Dmitry Kovtun, ., [, 114, ], [, 115, ], As such,  Litvinenko's death was the first (and,  to date,  only) confirmed instance in which polonium's extreme toxicity has been used with malicious intent., [, 116, ], [, 117, ], [, 118, ], In 2011,  an allegation surfaced that the death of, Palestinian, leader, Yasser Arafat,  who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes,  also resulted from deliberate polonium poisoning, [, 119, ], [, 120, ], and in July 2012,  concentrations of, 210, Po many times more than normal were detected in Arafat's clothes and personal belongings by the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne,  Switzerland., [, 121, ], [, 122, ], Even though Arafat's symptoms were acute gastroenteritis with diarrhoea and vomiting, [, 123, ], the institute's spokesman said that despite the tests the symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with, 210, Po poisoning,  and conclusions could not be drawn., [, 122, ], In 2013 the team found levels of polonium in Arafat's ribs and pelvis 18 to 36 times the average, [, 124, ], [, 125, ], even though by this point in time the amount had diminished by a factor of 2 million., [, 126, ], Forensic scientist Dave Barclay stated,  ""In my opinion,  it is absolutely certain that the cause of his illness was polonium poisoning. ... What we have got is the smoking gun - the thing that caused his illness and was given to him with malice."", [, 123, ], [, 124, ], Subsequently,  French and Russian teams claimed that the elevated, 210, Po levels were not the result of deliberate poisoning,  and did not cause Arafat's death., [, 127, ], [, 128, ], It has also been suspected that Russian businessman, Roman Tsepov, was killed with polonium. He had symptoms similar to Aleksander Litvinenko., [, 129, ], Treatment, [, edit, ], It has been suggested that, chelation agents,  such as British anti-Lewisite (, dimercaprol, ),  can be used to decontaminate humans., [, 130, ], In one experiment,  rats were given a fatal dose of 1.45 MBq/kg (8.7 ng/kg) of, 210, Po;, all untreated rats were dead after 44 days,  but 90% of the rats treated with the chelation agent, HOEtTTC remained alive for five months., [, 131, ], Detection in biological specimens, [, edit, ], Polonium-210 may be quantified in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally in a range of 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide., [, 132, ], Occurrence in humans and the biosphere, [, edit, ], Polonium-210 is widespread in the, biosphere,  including in human tissues,  because of its position in the, uranium-238 decay chain, . Natural, uranium-238, in the, Earth's crust, decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including, radium-226, to the radioactive noble gas, radon-222,  some of which,  during its 3.8-day half-life,  diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210,  much of which,  during its 138-day half-life,  is washed back down to the Earth's surface,  thus entering the biosphere,  before finally decaying to stable, lead-206, ., [, 133, ], [, 134, ], [, 135, ], As early as the 1920s,  French biologist, Antoine Lacassagne,  using polonium provided by his colleague, Marie Curie,  showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues,  with high concentrations,  particularly in, liver, kidney,  and, testes, ., [, 136, ], More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur,  also in group 16 of the periodic table,  in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules, [, 137, ], and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues., [, 138, ], Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans,  contributing appreciably to natural background dose,  with wide geographical and cultural variations,  and particularly high levels in arctic residents,  for example., [, 139, ], Tobacco, [, edit, ], Polonium-210, in tobacco contributes to many of the cases of, lung cancer, worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from, lead-210, deposited on tobacco leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 is a product of, radon-222, gas,  much of which appears to originate from the decay of, radium-226, from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils., [, 54, ], [, 140, ], [, 141, ], [, 142, ], [, 143, ], The presence of polonium in tobacco smoke has been known since the early 1960s., [, 144, ], [, 145, ], Some of the world's biggest tobacco firms researched ways to remove the substance—to no avail—over a 40-year period.

It was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2020 by, StudioCanal, and began streaming on, Amazon Prime Video, in the United States on 24 July 2020., Plot, [, edit, ], See also:, Acute radiation syndrome, In 1934, Marie Curie, collapses in her laboratory in Paris. As she is rushed to the hospital,  she remembers her life. In 1893 she was frequently rejected for funding due to her attitude,  which she had in common with, Pierre Curie, . This joint attitude issue with the leading academic authorities led her to share a laboratory with Pierre Curie., After Marie discovered, polonium, and, radium,  the two fell in love,  were married,  and had two children. Soon,  Marie announces the discovery of, radioactivity,  revolutionizing physics and chemistry. Radium is soon used in a series of commercial products. Pierre takes Marie to a, séance, where radium is used to attempt to contact the dead,  but Marie disapproves of, spiritualism, and the idea of an, afterlife, after the death of her mother in, Poland, ., Although Pierre rejects the, Légion d'honneur, for not nominating Marie and insists that the two jointly share their, Nobel Prize in Physics,  Marie becomes agitated that he accepted the Prize in, Stockholm, without her. Soon afterwards Pierre becomes increasingly sick with anemia as a result of his research and is, trampled to death by a horse, ., Marie initially dismisses concerns that her elements are toxic,  but increasing numbers of people die from serious health conditions after exposure to radium. Depressed,  she begins an affair with her colleague, Paul Langevin, . Although she receives Pierre's professorship at the, Sorbonne,  the French nationalist press reports the details of her affair with Langevin and she is harassed by xenophobic mobs due to her, Polish, origins. She returns to the house where she attended the seance and tearfully begs her friend, Loie Fuller,  who was there to try to use radium to contact Pierre. When she is awarded the, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in 1911,  she defies the committee's instructions not to travel to Stockholm and at her, award ceremony, receives, standing ovation, from the entire audience., In 1914,  when, World War I, starts,  her daughter Irene convinces her to run an, X-ray unit, on the, Western Front, in order to determine whether or not, amputation, is needed for wounded soldiers. Irene begins dating, Frédéric Joliot,  and Marie initially disapproves of that relationship because of their joint research into, induced radioactivity,  later asking Irene not to take part in Frédéric's future work on radioactivity because of possible effects on her health. Although Irene doesn't obey her mother,  they go to the, Western Front, together to run the X-ray machine., Scenes of Marie's life are interwoven with scenes depicting the future impact of her discoveries,  including, external beam radiotherapy, at a hospital in, Cleveland, in 1956,  the, atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  a nuclear bomb test in, Nevada, in 1961,  and the, Chernobyl disaster, in 1986. As she dies in 1934,  she sees visions of these events before awakening in a hospital room. Pierre arrives and they leave the hospital together. The film concludes by stating that the Curies' mobile unit X-rayed more than a million men during the war ""saving countless lives"",  that their research would be used to create, radiotherapy,  and that the Joliot-Curies would discover, artificial or induced radioactivity, in 1935., The movie ends with a photo showing Marie Curie's attendance at the 1927, Solvay Conference, with many other celebrated physicists such as, Albert Einstein, ., Cast, [, edit, ], Rosamund Pike, as, Marie Curie, Sam Riley, as, Pierre Curie, Sian Brooke, as, Bronia Sklodowska, Simon Russell Beale, as, Gabriel Lippmann, Anya Taylor-Joy, as, Irene Curie, Ariella Glaser as young Irene Curie, Indica Watson, as six-year-old Irene Curie, Cara Bossom as, Ève Curie, Aneurin Barnard, as, Paul Langevin, Edward Davis as, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Katherine Parkinson, as Emma Jeanne Desfosses, Tim Woodward, as, Alexandre Millerand, Jonathan Aris, as Hetreed, Mirjam Novak, as Nurse Francoise, Corey Johnson, as Adam Warner, Demetri Goritsas, as Dr. Jenkins, Michael Gould, as Judge Clark, Drew Jacoby, as, Loie Fuller, Paul Albertson as, Paul Tibbets, Production, [, edit, ], Development, [, edit, ], It was announced in February 2017 that, Marjane Satrapi, would direct a biopic on the life of, Marie Curie,  with, StudioCanal, and, Working Title Films, serving as producers.

She neglects her health and one day faints during class. Her tutor,  Prof. Perot is sympathetic and,  finding that she has no friends or family in Paris,  invites her to a, soirée, his wife is throwing for a ""few friends"" (primarily professors and their wives). Among the many guests is physicist, Pierre Curie,  an extremely shy and absentminded man completely devoted to his work. He allows Marie to share his lab and finds that she is a gifted scientist. Appalled that she plans on returning to Poland to teach after graduation rather than devoting her life to further study,  he takes her to visit his family in their country home. Marie and Pierre both tend to concentrate on science to the extent that they don't realize until the last minute they have fallen in love. Even when Pierre asks Marie to be his wife,  he does so in terms of reason,  logic and chemistry., Fascinated by a demonstration she saw as an undergraduate,  of a, pitchblende, rock that seems to generate enough energy to take small photographs,  Marie decides to make the rock's energy the subject of her doctoral study. The measurements she takes don't seem to add up,  and she decides there must be a  third, radioactive, element in the rock in addition to the two she knows are in it. In the midst of discussing this,  she discloses offhandedly to Pierre's family that she is pregnant., The physics department at the, Sorbonne, refuses to fund their research without more proof of the element's existence,  but allows them to use a dilapidated old shed across the courtyard from the physics building. In spite of its disadvantages,  they import eight tons of pitchblende, ore, and cook it down to look for the element they call, radium, . In spite of inability to separate out pure radium,  they know something is definitely there,  as Marie's hands are being burned. They hit on a tedious method of, crystallization, to arrive at pure radium., Now world-famous,  they go on vacation to rest after all the press conferences and the, Nobel Prize, . They're granted a new laboratory by the university; before its dedication,  Marie shows off her new dress,  inspiring Pierre to get her a set of earrings to go with it. Walking home in the rain,  he absentmindedly crosses the street in front of a delivery wagon,  and he is run down and killed. Marie almost loses her mind,  but after the concerned Prof. Perot counsels her,  she remembers Pierre's words that if one of them is gone,  the other must go on working just the same. Finally,  Marie gives a speech at the 25th anniversary celebration of the discovery of radium,  expressing her belief that science is the path to a better world., Cast, [, edit, ], Greer Garson, as, Marie Curie, Walter Pidgeon, as, Pierre Curie, Henry Travers, as, Eugène Curie, [, fr, ], Albert Bassermann, as, Prof. Jean Perot, Robert Walker, as David Le Gros, C.

Richards Monographs No. 2, Published by Vassar College, The Discovery, of, Radium, It is my, earnest desire that some of you shall carry on, this scientific work and will keep for your, ambition the determination to make a, permanent contribution to science, M. Curie, Address by, Madame M. Curie, at Vassar College, May 14,  1921, 1, PREFATORY NOTE, In her recent visit to America,  Madame Curie, conferred a special honor upon Vassar College by, delivering in the chapel on the evening of May fourteenth, the only extended address which she made in, this country. In a simple,  straightforward way she, told the story of her great achievement. One realized, how,  closely environed by all the great realities of human, experience,  in the face of tremendous difficulties and, with limited resources,  she had pursued undaunted her, search for truth., The discovery of radium gave Madame Curie immediate, distinction among scientists on account of the, extremely significant contribution she thereby made to, the great ultimate problem of physical science,  the, constitution of matter. The striking properties possessed, by radium gave to its discovery a world-wide, interest,  all the more intense because of the hope which, was inspired by the possible healing qualities of the, radiations from this new element., That hope is being realized in large measure. It is, therefore fitting that this address should have been, given by Madame Curie at Vassar and that it should, now be circulated among the members of the college, under the foundation in memory of Ellen S. Richards, who devoted her life to the public health., Edna Carter, Chairman of the Department of Physics., 2, THE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM, I could tell you many things about radium and radioactivity, and it would take a long time. But as we can not do that,  I, shall only give you a short account of my early work about, radium. Radium is no more a baby,  it is more than twenty, years old,  but the conditions of the discovery were somewhat, peculiar,  and so it is always of interest to remember them and, to explain them., We must go back to the year 1897. Professor Curie and I, worked at that time in the laboratory of the school of Physics, and Chemistry where Professor Curie held his lectures. I was, engaged in some work on uranium rays which had been discovered, two years before by Professor Becquerel. I shall tell, you how these uranium rays may be detected. If you take a, photographic plate and wrap it in black paper and then on this, plate,  protected from ordinary light,  put some uranium salt, and leave it a day,  and the next day the plate is developed, you notice on the plate a black spot at the place where the, uranium salt was. This spot has been made by special rays, which are given out by the uranium and are able to make an, impression on the plate in the same way as ordinary light., You can also test those rays in another way,  by placing them, on an electroscope. You know what an electroscope is. If, you charge it,  you can keep it charged several hours and more, unless uranium salts are placed near to it. But if this is the, case the electroscope loses its charge and the gold or aluminum, leaf falls gradually in a progressive way. The speed with which, the leaf moves may be used as a measure of the intensity of, the rays; the greater the speed,  the greater the intensity., I spent some time in studying the way of making good, measurements of the uranium rays,  and then I wanted to know, if there were other elements,  giving out rays of the same kind., So I took up a work about all known elements,  and their compounds, and found that uranium compounds are active and also, 3, all thorium compounds,  but other elements were not found, active,  nor were their compounds. As for the uranium and, thorium compounds,  I found that they were active in proportion, to their uranium or thorium content. The more uranium, or thorium,  the greater the activity,  the activity being an atomic, property of the elements,  uranium and thorium., Then I took up measurements of minerals and I found that, several of those which contain uranium or thorium or both, were active. But then the activity was not what I could, expect,  it was greater than for uranium or thorium compounds, like the oxides which are almost entirely composed of these, elements. Then I thought that there should be in the minerals, some unknown element having a much greater radioactivity, than uranium or thorium. And I wanted to find and to separate, that element,  and I settled to that work with Professor, Curie. We thought it would be done in several weeks or, months,  but it was not so. It took many years of hard work, to finish that task. There was not one new element,  there, were several of them. But the most important is radium, which could be separated in a pure state., All the tests for the separation were done by the method, of electrical measurements with some kind of electroscope., We just had to make chemical separations and to examine all, products obtained with respect to their activity. The product, which retained the radioactivity was considered as that one, which had kept the new element; and,  as the radioactivity was, more strong in some products,  we knew that we had succeeded, in concentrating the new element. The radioactivity was, used in the same way as a spectroscopical test., The difficulty was that there is not much radium in a mineral;, this we did not know at the beginning. But we now know, that there is not even one part of radium in a million parts of, good ore. And too,  to get a small quantity of pure radium, salt,  one is obliged to work up a huge quantity of ore. And, that was very hard in a laboratory., 4, We had not even a good laboratory at that time. We, worked in a hangar where there were no improvements,  no, good chemical arrangements. We had no help,  no money., And because of that the work could not go on as it would have, done under better conditions. I did myself the numerous, crystalizations which were wanted to get the radium salt, separated from the barium salt with which it is obtained out, of the ore. And in 1902 I finally succeeded in getting pure, radium chloride and determining the atomic weight of the, new element radium,  which is 226 while that of barium is only, 137., Later I could also separate the metal radium,  but that was, a very difficult work; and,  as it is not necessary for the use of, radium to have it in this state,  it is not generally prepared, that way., Now,  the special interest of radium is in the intensity of its, rays which is several million times greater than the uranium, rays. And the effects of the rays make the radium so important., If we take a practical point of view,  then the most important, property of the rays is the production of physiological effects, on the cells of the human organism. These effects may be, used for the cure of several diseases. Good results have been, obtained in many cases. What is considered particularly, important is the treatment of cancer. The medical utilization, of radium makes it necessary to get that element in sufficient, quantities. And so a factory of radium was started to begin, with in France,  and later in America where a big quantity of, ore named carnotite is available. America does produce many, grams of radium every year but the price is still very high, because the quantity of radium contained in the ore is so small., The radium is more than a hundred thousand times dearer, than gold., But we must not forget that when radium was discovered, no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The, work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific, 5, work must not be considered from the point of view of the, direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself,  for the, beauty of science,  and then there is always the chance that, a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit, for humanity., But science is not rich,  it does not dispose of important, means,  it does not generally meet recognition before the material, usefulness of it has been proved. The factories produce, many grams of radium every year,  but the laboratories have, very small quantities. It is the same for my laboratory and, I am very grateful to the American women who wish me to, have more of radium and give me the opportunity of doing, more work with it., The scientific history of radium is beautiful. The properties, of the rays have been studied very closely. We know that, particles are expelled from radium with a very great velocity, near to that of the light. We know that the atoms of radium, are destroyed by expulsion of these particles,  some of which, are atoms of helium. And in that way it has been proved, that the radioactive elements are constantly disintegrating, and that they produce at the end ordinary elements,  principally, helium and lead. That is,  as you see,  a theory of transformation, of atoms which are not stable,  as was believed before, but may undergo spontaneous changes., Radium is not alone in having these properties. Many, having other radioelements are known already,  the polonium, the mesothorium,  the radiothorium,  the actinium. We know, also radioactive gases,  named emanations. There is a great, variety of substances and effects in radioactivity. There is, always a vast field left to experimentation and I hope that we, may have some beautiful progress in the following years. It, is my earnest desire that some of you should carry on this, scientific work and keep for your ambition the determination, to make a permanent contribution to science., M.

I should have preferred confiding this task, to some relative or some friend of his infancy who had followed his, whole life intimately and possessed as full a knowledge of his earliest, years as of those after his marriage. Jacques Curie,  Pierre's brother, and the companion of his youth,  was bound to him by the tenderest, affection. But after his appointment to the University of Montpellier,  he, lived far from Pierre,  and he therefore insisted that I should write the, biography,  believing that no one else better knew and understood the, life of his brother. He communicated to me all his personal memories;, and to this important contribution,  which I have utilized in full,  I, have added details related by my husband himself and a few of his, friends. Thus I have reconstituted as best I could that part of his, existence that I did not know directly. I have,  in addition,  tried, faithfully to express the profound impression his personality made upon, me during the years of our life together., This narrative is,  to be sure,  neither complete nor perfect. I hope, nevertheless,  that the picture it gives of Pierre Curie is not deformed, and that it will help to conserve his memory. I wish,  too,  that it might, remind those who knew him of the reasons for which they loved him., M. C., CONTENTS, Introduction, CHAPTER, I., The Curie Family.

WILLIAM BROWN MELONEY, Every little while a man or a woman is born to serve in some big way., Such a one surely is Marie Curie. Her discovery of radium has advanced, science,  relieved human suffering and enriched the world. The spirit in, which she has done her work has challenged the minds and souls of men., One morning in the spring of 1898,  when the United States was going to, war with Spain,  Madame Curie stepped forth from a crude shack on the, outskirts of Paris,  with the greatest secret of the century literally in, the palm of her hand., It was one of the silent,  unheralded great moments in the world's, history., The discovery which had become a fact that morning was no accident. It, was a triumph over hardship and doubting men. It represented years of, patient labor. Madame Curie and her husband,  Pierre Curie,  had wrested, from Mother Earth one of her most priceless secrets., I have been asked to tell why I undertook the Marie Curie Radium, Campaign and how I persuaded Madame Curie to write this book., It is with much hesitancy that I venture to write a preface to this, book. She once chided me,  in her gentle way,  for an article in which I, had stated facts with some feeling—although the facts praised her., ""In science, "" she said,  ""we should be interested in things,  not persons."", Madame Curie is the most modest of women. It is only after long, persuasion that she has consented to record the autobiographical notes, contained in this book. Still,  so much has been left unsaid, uninterpreted,  that I feel an obligation to say a word toward a fuller, understanding of this great and noble character., In 1915 I wrote in my editor's suggestion book: ""Greatest woman's story, in the world—Marie Curie,  discoverer of radium."", For the next four years scarcely any writer of prominence went abroad, without a commission from me to bring back the story of Madame Curie., Always they returned with the report: ""She was not to be found, "" or ""She, was at the front somewhere, "" or ""She won't see journalists."" My own, letters to Madame Curie brought no reply. I did not know then that great, bags of mail from all parts of the world lay piled up in her laboratory, where there was no secretary,  while Madame Curie with her X-ray, apparatus was at the front,  relieving suffering and saving lives., In May,  1919,  another mission took me to Paris and I resolved to see, Madame Curie myself. My friend,  Stéphane Lauzanne,  Editor-in-Chief of, Le Matin,  said: ""Give it up. Become interested in something else;, she will see no one. She does nothing but work."", I began to ask questions., ""She is very simple and exceedingly retiring, "" said Lauzanne. ""Few, things in life are more distasteful to her than publicity. Her mind is, as exact and logical as science itself. She cannot accept or understand, exaggerations and inaccurate quotations. She cannot understand why, scientists,  rather than science,  should be discussed in the press. There, are but two things for her—her little family and her work., ""After the death of Pierre Curie,  the faculty and officials of the, University of Paris decided to depart from all precedent and appoint a, woman to a full professorship at the Sorbonne. Madame Curie accepted the, appointment and the date was set for her installation., ""It was the history-making afternoon of October 5th,  1906. The members, of the class which had formerly been instructed by Professor Pierre, Curie were seated in one group., ""There was present a large crowd—celebrities,  statesmen, academicians,  all the faculty. Suddenly through a small side door, entered a woman all in black,  with pale hands and high arched forehead., The magnificent forehead won notice first. It was not merely a woman who, stood before us,  but a brain—a living thought. Her appearance was, enthusiastically applauded for five minutes. When the applause died, down,  Madame Curie bent forward with slightly trembling lips. We, wondered what she was about to say. It was important. It was history, whatever she said., ""In the foreground sat a stenographer,  ready to record her words. Would, she speak of her husband? Would she thank the Minister and the public?, No,  she began quite simply as follows:, ""'When we consider the progress made by the theories of radio-activity, since the beginning of the Nineteenth Century—' The important thing, to this great woman is work. Time should not be wasted in idle words. And, so,  dispensing with all superficial formality,  with no betrayal of the, tremendous emotion which all but overcame her—except by the extreme, pallor of her face and the trembling of her lips—she continued her, lecture in clear,  well-modulated tones., ""It was typical of this great soul that she should carry on their work, courageously and without faltering., ""You will see, "" concluded Lauzanne,  ""it is useless to try to interrupt, her work for interviews."", Later I met one of Madame Curie's fellow scientists who sympathized with, my desire,  but who agreed with Lauzanne that an interview was, impossible. Finally,  however,  he promised to carry a letter to Madame, Curie., I wrote ten letters and destroyed them. In one I said: ""My father,  who, was a medical man,  wrote: 'It is impossible to exaggerate the, unimportance of people.' But you have been important to me for twenty, years,  and I want to see you a few minutes."", The answer came within an hour. I was to go to the laboratory the next, morning., I had been in Mr. Edison's laboratory a few weeks before sailing from, home. Edison is rich in the material things—as he should be. Every, kind of equipment is at his command. He is a power in the financial as well, as the scientific world. In my childhood I had lived near Alexander, Graham Bell; had admired his great house and his fine horses. A short, time before,  I had been in Pittsburgh,  where the sky is plumed by the, tall smoke stacks of the greatest radium reduction plants in the world., I remembered that millions of dollars had been spent on radium watches, and radium gun sights. Several millions of dollars' worth of radium was, even then stored in various parts of the United States. I had been, prepared to meet a woman of the world,  enriched by her own efforts and, established in one of the white palaces of the Champs d'Elysées or some, other beautiful boulevard of Paris., I found a simple woman,  working in an inadequate laboratory and living, in a simple apartment on the meager pay of a French professor., As I entered the new building at Number One Rue Pierre Curie,  which, stands out conspicuously among the old walls of the University of Paris, I had already formed a picture of the laboratory of the discoverer of, radium., I waited a few minutes in the bare little office which might have been, furnished from Grand Rapids,  Michigan. Then the door opened and I saw a, pale,  timid little woman in a black cotton dress,  with the saddest face, I had ever looked upon., Her well-formed hands were rough. I noticed a characteristic,  nervous, little habit of rubbing the tips of her fingers over the pad of her, thumb in quick succession. I learned later that working with radium had, made them numb. Her kind,  patient,  beautiful face had the detached, expression of a scholar. Suddenly I felt like an intruder., I was struck dumb. My timidity exceeded her own. I had been a trained, interrogator for twenty years,  but I could not ask a single question of, this gentle woman in a black cotton dress. I tried to explain that, American women were interested in her great work,  and found myself, apologizing for intruding upon her precious time. To put me at my ease, Madame Curie began to talk about America. She had for many years wanted, to visit my country,  but she could not be separated from her children., ""America, "" she said,  ""has about fifty grammes of radium. Four of these, are in Baltimore,  six in Denver,  seven in New York."" She went on naming, the location of every grain., ""And in France?"" I asked., ""My laboratory, "" she replied simply,  ""has hardly more than a gramme."", "", You, have only a gramme?"" I exclaimed. That meant less than, one-twenty-ninth of an ounce., ""I? Oh,  I have none, "" she corrected. ""It belongs to my laboratory."", I suggested royalties on her patents. Surely she had protected her right, to the processes by which radium is produced. The revenue from such, patents should have made her a very rich woman., Quietly,  and without any seeming consciousness of the tremendous, renunciation,  she said,  ""There were no patents. We were working in the, interests of science. Radium was not to enrich any one. Radium is an, element. It belongs to all people."", She had contributed to the progress of science and the relief of human, suffering,  and yet,  in the prime of her life she was without the tools, which would enable her to make further contribution of her genius., ""If you had the whole world to choose from, "" I asked impulsively,  ""what, would you take?"" It was a silly question,  perhaps,  but as it happened, a fateful one., ""You ought to have everything in the world you need to go on with your, work, "" I said. ""Some one must undertake this."", ""Who will?"" she asked rather hopelessly., ""The women of America, "" I promised—and then I rose to go., That week I learned that the market price of a gramme of radium was one, hundred thousand dollars. I also learned that Madame Curie's laboratory, although practically a new building,  was without sufficient equipment;, that the radium held there was used at that time only for extracting, emanations for hospital use in cancer treatment., I saw Madame Curie at the Institute again and then in her own home—a, small apartment in the Ile St. Louis,  where she lived with her two, daughters. It was a happy,  busy little family. They had no protest, against life except to regret that lack of equipment interfered with the, important research work Madame Curie and her daughter,  Irene,  should, have been doing., It was my hope when I arrived in New York,  a few weeks afterwards,  to, find ten women to subscribe ten thousand dollars each for the purchase, of a gramme of radium,  and in this way to enable Madame Curie to go on, with her work,  without the publicity of a general campaign. That hope, was soon dashed. I found one or two such women,  but not ten., There were not ten to buy that gramme of radium but there were a hundred, thousand women and a group of men to help,  who determined the money must, be raised., My first direct and substantial support came from Mrs. William Vaughn, Moody,  widow of the American poet and playwright., When we found it would be necessary to launch a national campaign,  Mrs., Robert G. Mead,  a doctor's daughter,  and one who had been a standby in, cancer prevention work,  became secretary,  and Mrs. Nicholas F. Brady an, executive member of the committee. Behind these women stood a group of, scientific men,  who knew what radium had meant to humanity,  among them, Dr. Robert Abbe,  the first American surgeon to use radium,  and Dr., Francis Carter Wood., In less than a year the fund had been raised., Stéphane Lauzanne describes a second impressive moment in the life of, Madame Curie. It was nearly a year after my talk with her. It was, fifteen years since that scene at the University of Paris. These years, had been spent in her laboratory; she had made no public appearance. It, was in March,  1921,  that Monsieur Lauzanne heard her voice again., ""I lifted the telephone receiver, "" he relates,  ""and heard these words:, 'Madame Curie wishes to speak to you.' What extraordinary, event—what tragedy,  perhaps,  might this not mean? And suddenly, over the wire came the sound of the voice which I had heard only once, before,  but which had stayed in my memory—the same voice which had, once pronounced the words,  'When we consider the progress made by the, theories of radio-activity since the beginning of the Nineteenth, Century——', ""'I wanted to tell you that I am going to America, ' she said. 'It was, very hard for me to decide to go,  because America is so far and so big., If some one did not come for me,  I should probably never have made the, trip. I should have been too frightened. But to this fear is added a, great joy. I have devoted my life to the science of radio-activity and I, know all we owe to America in the field of science. I am told you are, among those who strongly favor this distant trip,  so I wanted to tell, you I have decided to go,  but please don't let any one know about it.', ""This great woman—the greatest woman in France—was speaking, haltingly,  tremblingly,  almost like a little girl. She,  who handles, daily a particle of radium more dangerous than lightning,  was afraid, when confronted by the necessity of appearing before the public."", A little later,  when Madame Curie and I had embarked for America,  where, she was to receive her radium and other experimental material,  I asked, her if,  the day I had first given her the promise,  she had believed that, American women would rally to her aid., ""No, "" she confessed honestly,  ""but I knew you were sincere."", About the time of her marriage,  one of her relatives gave Madame Curie a, gift of money to be used for a trousseau. It was not a great sum,  but, important to the poor student in Paris. To understand the significance, of the use to which she put this fund,  it is necessary to remember that, Marie Sklodowska was young,  and possessed physical beauty and charm. She, was not without appreciation of the beautiful,  and she could not, possibly have been utterly unconscious of her own appearance. She had a, young girl's natural interest in pretty clothes. She considered the, purchase of a wedding gown and other personal belongings,  and then,  with, her characteristic exactness,  measured her needs and the future., She was married in a simple dress she had brought from Poland,  and her, trousseau fund was spent on two bicycles,  so that she and Pierre Curie, might enjoy the beautiful country of France. That was their honeymoon., One dream that Madame Curie held,  and still holds unrealized,  is the, hope of a quiet little home of her own with a garden and hedge,  and, flowers and birds. During her American travels,  she would frequently, glance through the window as the train passed through a small town,  and, spying some modest little house with a garden,  would say,  ""I have always, wanted such a little home."", But owning a house was secondary in the life of both Pierre and Marie, Curie. They simply made a home wherever they lived,  for such money as, might have gone for the purchase of her little dream house was always, needed in the laboratory. She told me one day,  with deep feeling,  that, one of the regrets of her life was that Pierre Curie had died without, ever having had a permanent laboratory., She had,  as I have said,  refused opportunities to come to the United, States because she could not endure separation from her children. She, was,  I think,  finally persuaded to face the long trip and the terrifying, publicity attending it,  partly because of her gratitude for the support, given her scientific work,  but principally because it offered a splendid, opportunity for travel to her daughters., There is in Madame Curie none of the legendary coldness and, thoughtlessness attributed to the scientist. During the war,  when she, ran her own radiological truck and lived on the march from hospital to, hospital in the zone of operations,  she washed and dried and pressed her, own clothes. Once during our American travels,  we stayed in a home where, there were several other house guests besides our party of five. I, entered Madame Curie's room and found her washing her underclothes., ""It is nothing at all, "" she said,  when I protested. ""I know perfectly, well how to do it,  and with all of these extra guests in the house,  the, servants have enough to do."", On the night before the reception at the White House,  at which President, Harding was to present the gramme of radium to Madame Curie,  the Deed, was brought to Madame Curie. It was a beautifully engraved scroll, prepared in the office of Coudert Brothers,  vesting all rights to a, gramme of radium,  the gift of American women,  in Madame Curie., She read the paper carefully,  and then,  after a few moments of thought, said: ""It is very fine and generous,  but it must not be left this way., This gramme of radium represents a great deal of money,  but more than, that,  it represents the women of this country. It is not for me; it is, for science. I am not well; I may die any day. My daughter Eve is not of, legal age,  and if I should die it would mean that this radium would go, to my estate and would be divided between my daughters. It is not for, that purpose. This radium must be consecrated for all time to the use of, science. Will you have your lawyer draw a paper which will make this, very clear?"", I said that it would be done in a few days., ""It must be done to-night, "" she said. ""To-morrow I receive the radium, and I might die tomorrow. Too much is at stake."", And so,  late as it was on that hot May evening,  after some difficulty, we secured the services of a lawyer,  who prepared the paper from a draft, Madame Curie herself had written. She signed it before starting for, Washington., This document read:, ""In the event of my death I give to the Institut du Radium,  of Paris, for exclusive use in the Laboratoire Curie,  the gramme of radium which, was given to me by the Executive Committee of Women of the Marie Curie, Radium Fund,  pursuant to an agreement dated the 19th day of May,  1921."", This act was consistent with the whole life of the discoverer of radium;, with the answer she had made to my question a year before:, ""Radium is not to enrich any one. It is an element; it is for all, people."", During her American travels,  I repeatedly requested Madame Curie to, write the story of her life. I urged its importance to history and its, influence among students preparing to consecrate their lives to science., Finally she consented. ""But it will not be much of a book, "" she said., ""It is such an uneventful,  simple little story. I was born in Warsaw of, a family of teachers. I married Pierre Curie and had two children. I, have done my work in France."", A simple statement,  but fraught with what meaning! When most of us shall, have been forgotten,  when even the Great World War shall have dwindled, to a few pages in the history books,  when Governments shall have fallen, and risen and fallen again,  the work of Marie Curie will be remembered., Of her work and her husband's,  volumes—veritable, libraries—have been written since that spring morning in 1898, when after an all night vigil in a shack on the outskirts of Paris,  she, came forth with the great gift of radium to mankind. Scientists will go, on adding to the bibliography of the marvelous element. But of Marie, Curie herself,  the woman,  it is unlikely that the world will ever read, more than the brief notes which compose this small book., It is her conviction,  her philosophy,  that ""In science we should be, interested in things,  not persons."", CHAPTER I, THE CURIE FAMILY. INFANCY AND FIRST, STUDIES OF PIERRE CURIE, Pierre Curie's parents,  who were educated and intelligent,  formed a part, of the, petite bourgeoisie, of small means. They did not frequent, fashionable society,  but confined themselves entirely to the, companionship of their relatives and a few intimate friends., Eugène Curie,  Pierre's father,  was a physician and the son of a, physician. He knew very few kinsmen of his name,  and very little about, the Curie family,  which was of Alsatian (Eugène Curie was born at, Mulhouse in 1827) and Protestant origin. Even though his father was, established in London,  Eugène had been brought up in Paris,  where he, pursued his studies in the natural sciences and medicine,  and worked as, preparator under Gratiollet in the laboratories of the Museum., Doctor Eugène Curie's remarkable personality impressed all who, approached him. He was a tall man,  who in youth must have been blonde, with beautiful blue eyes of a clearness and brilliancy that were, striking even in an advanced old age. These eyes,  which had retained a, child-like expression,  reflected goodness and intelligence. He had, indeed unusual intellectual capacities,  a very live aptitude for the, natural sciences,  and the temperament of a scholar., Although he wished to consecrate his life to scientific work,  family, responsibilities following his marriage and the birth of two sons forced, him to renounce this desire. The necessities of life obliged him to, practice his medical profession. He continued,  however,  such, experimental research as his means permitted,  in particular undertaking, an investigation upon inoculation for tuberculosis at a time when the, bacterial nature of this malady was not yet established. His scientific, avocations developed in him the habit of making excursions in search of, the plants and animals necessary to his experiments,  and this habit,  as, well as his love of Nature,  gave him a marked preference for country, life. Until the end of his life he conserved his love for science,  and, without doubt,  also,  his regret at not having been able to devote, himself exclusively to it., His medical career remained always a modest one,  but it revealed, remarkable qualities of devotion and disinterestedness. At the time of, the Revolution of 1848,  when he was still a student,  the Government of, the Republic conferred on him a medal,  ""for his honorable and courageous, conduct"" in serving the wounded. He himself had been struck,  on February, 24th,  by a ball which shattered a part of his jaw. A little later, during a cholera epidemic,  he installed himself,  in order that he might, look after the sick,  in a quarter of Paris deserted by physicians., During the Commune he established a hospital in his apartment (rue de la, Visitation) near which there was a barricade,  and there he cared for the, wounded. Through this act of civism and because of his advanced, convictions he lost a part of his, bourgeois, patronage. At this time, he accepted the position of medical inspector of the organization for the, protection of young children. The duties of this post permitted him to, live in the suburbs of Paris where health conditions for himself and his, family were much better than those of the city., Doctor Curie had very pronounced political convictions. Temperamentally, an idealist,  he had embraced with ardor that republican doctrine which, inspired the revolutionaries of 1848. He was united in friendship with, Henri Brisson and the men of his group. Like them,  a free thinker and an, anticlerical,  he did not have his sons baptized,  nor did he have them, practice any form of religion., Pierre's mother,  Claire Depouilly,  was the daughter of a prominent, manufacturer of Puteaux,  near Paris. Her father and brothers, distinguished themselves through their numerous inventions connected, with the making of dyes and special tissues. The family,  which was of, Savoy,  was caught in the business catastrophe caused by the Revolution, of 1848,  and ruined. And these reverses of fortune,  added to those which, Doctor Curie had experienced during his career,  meant that he and his, family lived always in comparatively straightened circumstances,  with, the difficulties of existence often renewed. Even though raised for a, life of ease,  Pierre's mother accepted with tranquil courage the, precarious conditions which life brought her,  and gave proof of an, extreme devotion as she made life easier for her husband and children by, her activity and her good will., If the circumstances in which Jacques and Pierre grew up were modest and, not free from cares,  nevertheless there reigned in the family an, atmosphere of gentleness and affection. In speaking to me for the first, time of his parents,  Pierre Curie said that they were ""exquisite."", They were,  in truth,  that. The father's spirit was a little, authoritative—always awake and active. And he possessed a rare, unselfishness. He neither wished nor knew how to profit by personal, relations to ameliorate his condition. He loved his wife and sons, tenderly,  and was ever ready to aid all who needed him. The mother was, slight,  vivid in character,  and,  even though her health had suffered, through the birth of her sons,  was always gay and active in the simple, home that she so well knew how to make attractive and hospitable., When I first knew them they lived at Sceaux,  rue des Sablons (to-day rue, Pierre Curie) in a little house of ancient construction half concealed, amidst the verdure of a pretty garden. Their life was peaceful. Doctor, Curie went where his duties called him,  either in Sceaux or in, neighboring localities. Beyond this he occupied himself with his garden, or his reading. Near relatives and neighbors came to visit on Sundays, when bowling and chess were the favorite amusements. From time to time, Henri Brisson sought out his old companion in his tranquil retreat., Great calm and serenity enveloped the garden,  the dwelling,  and its, inhabitants., Pierre Curie was born the 15th of May,  1859,  in a house facing the, Jardin des Plantes,  rue Cuvier,  where his parents lived at the time when, his father was working in the Museum laboratories. He was the second son, of Doctor Curie and three and a half years younger than his brother, Jacques. In after life he retained few particularly characteristic, memories of his childhood in Paris; yet he did tell me how vividly, present in his mind were the days of the Commune,  the battle on the, barricade so near the house where he then lived,  the hospital, established by his father,  and the expeditions,  on which his brother, accompanied him,  in search of the wounded., It was in 1883 that Pierre moved with his parents from the capital to, the suburbs of Paris,  living first,  from 1883 to 1892,  at, Fontenay-aux-Roses,  then at Sceaux from 1892 to 1895,  the year of our, marriage., Pierre passed his childhood entirely within the family circle; he never, went to the elementary school nor to the lycée. His earliest, instruction was given him first by his mother and was then continued by, his father and his elder brother,  who himself had never followed in any, complete way the course of the lycée. Pierre's intellectual capacities, were not those which would permit the rapid assimilation of a prescribed, course of studies. His dreamer's spirit would not submit itself to the, ordering of the intellectual effort imposed by the school. The, difficulty he experienced in following such a program was usually, attributed to a certain slowness of mind. He himself believed that he, had this slow mind and often said so. I think,  however,  that this belief, was not entirely justified. It seems to me,  rather,  that already from, his early youth it was necessary for him to concentrate his thought with, great intensity upon a certain definite object,  in order to obtain a, precise result,  and that it was impossible for him to interrupt or to, modify the course of his reflections to suit exterior circumstances. It, is clear that a mind of this kind can hold within itself great future, possibilities. But it is no less clear that no system of education has, been especially provided by the public school for persons of this, intellectual category,  which nevertheless includes more representatives, than one would believe at first sight., Very fortunately for Pierre,  who could not,  as we can see,  become a, brilliant pupil in a lycée,  his parents had a sufficiently keen, intelligence to understand his difficulty,  and they refrained from, demanding of their son an effort which would have been prejudicial to, his development. If,  then,  Pierre's earliest instruction was irregular, and incomplete,  it had the advantage of not so weighing on his, intelligence as to deform it by dogmas,  prejudices or preconceived, ideas. And he was always grateful to his parents for this very liberal, attitude. He grew up in all freedom,  developing his taste for natural, science through his excursions into the country,  where he collected, plants and animals for his father. These excursions,  which he made, either alone or with one of the family,  helped to awake in him a great, love of Nature,  a passion which endured to the end of his life., Intimate contact with Nature,  which,  because of the artificial, conditions of city life and of traditional education,  few children can, know,  had a decisive influence on Pierre's development. Guided by his, father,  he learned to observe facts and to interpret them correctly. He, became familiar with the animals and plants of the environs of Paris. He, knew which ones could be found at each season of the year in the forests, and fields,  the streams and ponds. The ponds in particular had for him, an ever new attraction with their characteristic vegetation and their, population of frogs,  tritons,  salamanders,  dragonflies,  and other, denizens of air and water. No efforts to obtain the objects of his, interests seemed too great for him. He never hesitated to take any, animal in his hands in order to examine it more closely. Later,  after, our marriage,  in our walks together,  if I made some objection to letting, him put a frog into my hands,  he would exclaim: ""But no,  see how pretty, it is!"" He loved always,  too,  to bring back bouquets of wild flowers, from his walks., Thus his knowledge of natural history progressed rapidly. At the same, time,  also,  he was mastering the elements of mathematics. His classical, studies,  on the contrary,  had been much neglected,  and it was, principally through general reading that he acquired a knowledge of, literature and history. His father,  who was widely cultured,  possessed a, library containing many French and foreign works. Having himself a very, pronounced taste for reading,  he was able to communicate it to his son., When he was about fourteen years old,  a very happy event occurred in, Pierre's education. He was put under an excellent professor,  A. Bazille, who taught him elementary and advanced mathematics. This master was able, to appreciate his young pupil,  became much attached to him,  and directed, his work with the greatest solicitude. He even helped him to advance in, his study of Latin,  in which he was very much behind. At the same time, Pierre and Albert Bazille,  his professor's son,  became friends., This teaching had,  I am sure,  a great influence on the mind of Pierre, aiding him to develop and to sound the depth of his faculties and to, realize his capacities for science. He had a remarkable aptitude for, mathematics,  which expressed itself chiefly by a characteristic, geometric spirit and a great power of spatial vision. He,  therefore, progressed rapidly and joyfully in his studies under M. Bazille,  for, whom he always felt an unalterable gratitude., He once told me something which proved that even at this time he was not, content solely to follow a fixed program of studies,  but that he had, already begun to launch out into personal investigation. Strongly, attracted by the theory of determinants,  which he had just mastered,  he, undertook to realize an analogous conception,  but in three dimensions, and endeavored to discover the properties and uses of these ""cubical, determinants."" Needless to say that at his age,  and with the knowledge, then at his disposal,  such an enterprise was beyond his powers. The, attempt,  however,  was none the less indicative of his awakening, inventive spirit., Several years later,  when preoccupied with reflections upon symmetry,  he, asked himself the question: ""Could not one find a general method for the, solution of any equation whatever? Everything is a question of, symmetry."" He did not then know of Galois' theory of groups which had, made it possible to attack this problem. But he was happy later to learn, its results in the geometric applications to the case of equations of, the 5th degree., Thanks to his rapid progress in mathematics and physics,  Pierre Curie, was made a bachelor of science at the age of sixteen years. With this he, passed his most difficult stage of formal education. The only thing with, which he had to concern himself in the future was the acquisition of, knowledge through his personal and independent effort in a field of, science freely chosen., CHAPTER II, DREAMS OF YOUTH. FIRST SCIENTIFIC WORK., DISCOVERY OF PIEZO-ELECTRICITY, Pierre Curie was still very young when he began his higher studies in, preparation for the licentiate in physics. He followed the lectures and, laboratory work at the Sorbonne and had,  besides,  access to the, laboratory of Professor Leroux in the School of Pharmacy,  where he, assisted in the preparation of the physics courses. At the same time he, became further acquainted with laboratory methods by working with his, brother Jacques,  who was then preparator of chemistry courses under, Riche and Jungfleisch., Pierre received his licentiate in physical sciences at the age of, eighteen. During his studies he had attracted the attention of Desains, director of the University laboratory,  and of Mouton,  assistant director, of the same laboratory. Thanks to their appreciation he was appointed, when only nineteen years old,  preparator for Desains and placed in, charge of the students' laboratory work in physics. He held this, position five years,  and it was during this time that he began his, experimental research., It is to be regretted that because of his financial situation Pierre was, obliged,  at this early age of nineteen,  to accept the post of preparator, instead of being able to give his whole time for two or three years, longer to his University studies. With his time thus absorbed by his, professional duties and his investigations he had to give up following, the lectures in higher mathematics,  and he therefore passed no further, examinations. In compensation,  however,  he was released from military, service in conformity with the privileges at that time accorded young, men who undertook to serve as teachers in the public-school system., He was by this time a tall and slender young man with chestnut-colored, hair and a shy and reserved expression. At the same time his youthful, face mirrored a profound inner life. One has such an impression of him, as he appears in a good group photograph of Doctor Curie's family. His, head is resting on his hand in a pose of abstraction and reverie,  and, one cannot but be struck by the expression of the large,  limpid eyes, that seem to be following some inner vision. Beside him the brown-haired, brother offers a striking contrast,  his vivacious eyes and whole, appearance suggesting decision., The two brothers loved each other tenderly and lived as good comrades, being accustomed to work together in the laboratory and walk together in, their free hours. They also kept up affectionate relations with a few of, their childhood friends: Louis Depouilly,  their cousin,  who became a, physician; Louis Vauthier,  also later a physician; and Albert Bazille, who became an engineer in the post and telegraph service., Pierre used to tell me of the vivid memories he had of the vacations, passed at Draveil on the Seine,  where,  with his brother Jacques,  he took, long walks beside the river,  agreeably interrupted by swimming and, diving in the stream. Both brothers were excellent swimmers. Sometimes, they tramped for entire days. They had,  at an early age,  acquired the, habit of visiting the suburbs of Paris on foot. At times also Pierre, made solitary excursions which well suited his meditative spirit. On, these occasions he lost all sense of time,  and went to the extreme limit, of his physical forces. Absorbed in delightful contemplation of the, things about him,  he was not conscious of material difficulties., On the pages of a diary written in 1879, [1], he thus expressed the, salutary influence of the country upon him:, ""Oh,  what a good time I have passed there in that gracious solitude,  so, far from the thousand little worrying things that torment me in Paris., No,  I do not regret my nights passed in the woods,  and my solitary days., If I had the time I would let myself recount all my musings. I would, also describe my delicious valley,  filled with the perfume of aromatic, plants,  the beautiful mass of foliage,  so fresh and so humid,  that hung, over the Bièvre,  the fairy palace with its colonnades of hops,  the, stony hills,  red with heather,  where it was so good to be. Oh,  I shall, remember always with gratitude the forest of the Minière; of all the, woods I have seen,  it is this one that I have loved most and where I, have been happiest. Often in the evening I would start out and ascend, again this valley,  and I would return with twenty ideas in my head."", Thus,  for Pierre Curie,  the sensation of well-being he experienced in, the country was derived from the opportunity for tranquil reflection., Daily life in Paris with its numerous interruptions did not permit of, undisturbed concentration,  and this was to him a cause of inquietude and, suffering. He felt himself destined for scientific research; for him the, necessity was imperative of comprehending the phenomena of Nature in, order to form a satisfactory theory to explain them. But when trying to, fix his mind on some problem he had frequently to turn aside because of, the multiplicity of futile things that disturbed his reflections and, plunged him into discouragement., Under the heading,  ""A day like too many others, "" he enumerated in his, diary a list of the puerile happenings that had completely filled one of, his days,  leaving no time for useful work. He then concluded: ""There is, my day,  and I have accomplished nothing. Why?"" Further on he returns to, the same theme under a title borrowed from Victor Hugo's ""Le Roi, S'Amuse, "", ""To deafen with little bells the spirit that would think."", ""In order that,  weak one that I am,  I shall not let my head turn with, all the winds,  yielding to the least breath that touches it,  it is, necessary that all should be immobile about me,  or that,  like a spinning, top,  movement alone should render me insensible to external objects., ""When,  in the process of turning slowly upon myself,  I try to gain, momentum,  a nothing,  a word,  a story,  a paper,  a visit stops me and is, able to put off or retard forever the moment when,  granted a sufficient, swiftness I might have,  in spite of my surroundings,  concentrated on my, own intention.... We must eat,  drink,  sleep,  be idle,  love,  touch the, sweetest things of life and yet not succumb to them. It is necessary, that,  in doing all this,  the higher thoughts to which one is dedicated, remain dominant and continue their unmoved course in our poor heads. It, is necessary to make a dream of life,  and to make of a dream a reality."", This acute analysis,  sufficiently surprising in a young man of twenty, years,  suggests in an admirable manner the conditions necessary to the, highest manifestations of the intellect. It carries a lesson which,  if, it were sufficiently understood,  would facilitate the way of all, contemplative spirits capable of opening new paths for humanity., The unity of thought toward which Pierre Curie strove was troubled not, only by professional and social obligations but also by his tastes, which urged him towards a broad literary and artistic culture. Like his, father,  he loved reading,  and did not fear to undertake arduous literary, tasks. To some criticism made in this connection,  he responded readily:, ""I do not dislike tedious books."" This meant that he was fascinated by, the search after truth which is sometimes associated with writing devoid, of charm. He also loved painting and music,  and went gladly to look at, pictures or to attend a concert. A few fragments of poetry in his, handwriting were left among his papers., But all these preoccupations were subordinated in his mind to what he, considered his true task,  and when his scientific imagination was not in, full activity,  he felt himself,  in a sense,  an incomplete being. He, expressed this inquietude with an emotion born of his suffering during, momentary periods of depression., ""What shall I become?"" he wrote. ""Very rarely have I command of all, myself; ordinarily a part of me sleeps. My poor spirit,  are you then so, weak that you cannot control my body? Oh,  my thoughts,  you count indeed, for very little! I should have the greatest confidence in the power of, my imagination to pull me out of the rut,  but I greatly fear that my, imagination is dead."", But despite hesitations,  doubts,  and lost moments,  the young man was, little by little striking out his path and strengthening his will. He, was resolutely carrying on fruitful investigations at an age when many, men who were to become savants were as yet only pupils., His first work,  done in collaboration with Desains,  concerned the, determination of the lengths of heat waves with the aid of a, thermoelectric element and a metallic wire grating,  a process,  then, entirely new,  which has since often been employed in the study of this, question., Following this he undertook an investigation on crystals in, collaboration with his brother,  who had passed his licentiate and was, preparator for Friedel in the laboratory of mineralogy at the Sorbonne., Their experiments led the two young physicists to a great success: the, discovery of the hitherto unknown phenomena of piezo-electricity,  which, consists of an electric polarization produced by the compression or the, expansion of crystals in the direction of the axis of symmetry. This was, by no means a chance discovery. It was the result of much reflection on, the symmetry of crystalline matter,  which enabled the brothers to, foresee the possibilities of such polarization. The first part of the, investigation was made in Friedel's laboratory. With an experimental, skill rare at their age,  the young men succeeded in making a complete, study of the new phenomenon,  established the conditions of symmetry, necessary to its production in crystals,  and stated its remarkably, simple quantitative laws,  as well as its absolute magnitude for certain, crystals. Several well-known scientists of other nations (Roentgen, Kundt,  Voigt,  Riecke) have made further investigations along this new, road opened by Jacques and Pierre Curie., The second part of the work,  and much more difficult to realize, experimentally,  concerned the compression resulting in piezo-electric, crystals when they are exposed to the action of an electric field. This, phenomenon,  foreseen by Lippmann,  was demonstrated by the Curie, brothers. The difficulty of the experiment lay in the minuteness of the, deformations that had to be observed. Fortunately Desains and Mouton, placed a small room adjoining the physics laboratory at the disposal of, the brothers so that they might proceed successfully with their delicate, operations., From these researches,  as much theoretical as experimental,  they, immediately deduced a practical application,  in the form of a new, apparatus,  a piezo-electric quartz electrometer,  which measures in, absolute terms small quantities of electricity,  as well as electric, currents of low intensity. This apparatus has since then rendered great, service in experiments in radioactivity., [2], During the course of their experiments on piezo-electricity the Curies, were obliged to employ electrometric apparatus,  and,  not being able to, use the quadrant electrometer known at that time,  they developed a new, form of that instrument,  better adapted to their necessities. This, became known in France as the Curie electrometer. Thus these years of, collaboration between the two brothers,  always intimately united,  proved, both happy and fruitful. Their devotion and their common interest in, science were to them both a stimulant and a support. During their work, the vivacity and energy of Jacques were of precious aid to Pierre, always more easily absorbed by his thoughts., However,  this beautiful and close collaboration lasted only a few years., In 1883,  Pierre and Jacques were obliged to separate; Jacques left for, the University of Montpellier as Head Lecturer in Mineralogy (, Maître de, Conferences, ). Pierre was made Director of Laboratory Work in the School, of Industrial Physics and Chemistry founded by the city of Paris at the, suggestion of Friedel and of Schützenberger,  who became its first, director. Their remarkable researches with crystals won for the brothers, in 1895—very late,  it is true—the Planté prize., [1], Pierre Curie did not leave a veritable diary but only a few, pages as chance permitted,  covering but a short period of his life., [2], The piezo-electric property of quartz has recently had an, important application; it has been utilized by P. Langevin in the, production of elastic waves of high frequency (beyond sound) sent out in, water with the aim of detecting submarine obstacles. This same method, can serve in a more general manner to explore ocean depths. We see, here,  once again,  how pure speculation can lead to discoveries that will, be useful later in unforeseen directions., CHAPTER III, LIFE AS THE DIRECTOR OF LABORATORY WORK, IN THE SCHOOL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY., GENERALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLE, OF SYMMETRY. INVESTIGATIONS OF MAGNETISM, It was in the School of Physics,  in the old buildings of the Collège, Rollin,  that Pierre Curie was destined to work,  first as Director of, Laboratory Work,  then as Professor,  for twenty-two years,  a period, covering practically the whole of his scientific life. His memory seemed, to cling to these old buildings,  now destroyed,  in which he had passed, all his days,  returning only in the evening to his parents in the, country. He counted himself fortunate since he enjoyed the favor of the, Founder-Director Schützenberger,  and the esteem and good will of his, students,  many of whom became his disciples and friends. In alluding to, this experience,  at the close of an address delivered at the Sorbonne, near the end of his life,  he said:, ""I desire to recall here that we have made all our investigations in the, School of Physics and Chemistry of the city of Paris. In all creative, scientific work the influence of the surroundings in which one works is, of great importance,  and a part of the result is due to that influence., For more than twenty years I have worked in the School of Physics and, Chemistry. Schützenberger,  the first director of the School,  was an, eminent scientist. I remember with gratitude that he procured for me, opportunities for my own investigations when I was yet but an assistant., Later,  he permitted Madame Curie to work beside me,  an authorization, which was at that time far from an ordinary innovation., ""Schützenberger allowed us all great liberty; his direction made itself, felt chiefly through his inspiring love of science. The professors of, the School of Physics and Chemistry,  and the students who have gone from, it,  have created a kindly and stimulating atmosphere that has been, extremely helpful to me. It is among the old students of the school that, we have found our collaborators and our friends. I am happy to be able, here,  to thank them all."", The newly appointed director of the laboratory was,  when he first, assumed his duties,  scarcely older than his students,  who loved him, because of his extreme simplicity of manner,  which was much more that of, a comrade than of a master. Some of these students recall with emotion, their work carried on with him and his discussion at the blackboard, where he readily allowed himself to be led to debate scientific matters, to their great profit both in information and in kindled enthusiasm. At, a dinner given in 1903 by the Association of Former Students of the, School,  which he attended,  he laughingly recalled an incident of this, period. One day after lingering late with several students in the, laboratory,  he found the door locked,  and they all had to climb down, from the first floor single file,  along a pipe that ran near one of the, windows., Because of his reserve and shyness he did not make acquaintances easily, but those whose work brought them near him loved him because of his, kindliness. This was true of his subordinates during his entire life. In, the school his laboratory helper,  whom he had aided under trying, circumstances,  thought of him with the greatest gratitude,  in fact,  with, veritable adoration., Although separated from his brother,  he remained bound to him by their, former bond of love and confidence. During vacations,  Jacques Curie, would come to him that they might renew again that valuable, collaboration to which both willingly sacrificed their periods of, liberty. At times it was Pierre who joined Jacques,  who was engaged in, making a geological chart of the Auvergne country,  and there they, covered together the daily distances necessary to the tracing of such a, map., Here are a few memories of these long walks,  extracts from a letter, written to me shortly before our marriage:, ""I have been very happy to pass a little time with my brother. We have, been far from all immediate care,  and so isolated by our manner of, living that we have not even been able to receive a letter,  never, knowing one night where we would sleep the next. At times it seemed to, me that we had gone back to the days when we lived entirely together., Then we always arrived at the same opinions about all things,  with the, result that it was no longer necessary for us to speak in order to, understand each other. This was all the more astonishing because we, differed so entirely in character."", From the point of view of scientific investigation,  one must recognize, that the nomination of Pierre Curie to the School of Physics and, Chemistry retarded from the very first his experimental research., Indeed,  at the time of his appointment nothing yet existed in that, establishment; everything had to be created. Even the walls and the, partitions were hardly yet in place. He had,  therefore,  to organize, completely the laboratory and its work,  and he acquitted himself of this, task in a remarkable manner,  injecting into it the spirit of precision, and originality so characteristic of him., The direction of the laboratory work of the large number of students, (thirty by promotion) was alone a strain on a young man,  assisted as he, was only by one laboratory helper. The first years were,  therefore,  hard, years of assiduous work,  of benefit chiefly to the students trained and, developed by the young laboratory director., He himself profited by this enforced interruption of his experimental, research by trying to complete his scientific studies and,  in, particular,  his knowledge of mathematics. At the same time he became, engrossed in considerations of a theoretical nature on the relations, between crystallography and physics., In 1884 he published a memoir on questions of the order and repetition, that are at the base of the study of the symmetry of crystals. This was, followed in the same year by a more general treatment of the same, subject. Another article on symmetry and its repetitions appeared in, 1885. In that year he published,  too,  a very important theoretical, work, [3], on the formation of crystals,  and the capillary constants of, the different faces., This rapid succession of investigations shows how completely engrossed, Pierre Curie was in the subject of the physics of crystals. Both his, theoretical and his experimental research in this domain grouped itself, around a very general principle,  the principle of symmetry,  that he had, arrived at step by step,  and which he only definitely enunciated in, memoirs published between the years 1893 and 1895., The following is the form,  already classic,  in which he made his, announcement:, ""When certain causes produce certain effects,  the elements of symmetry, in the causes ought to reappear in the effects produced., ""When certain effects reveal a certain dissymmetry,  this dissymmetry, should be apparent in the causes which have given them birth., ""The converse of these two statements does not hold,  at least, practically; that is to say,  the effects produced can be more, symmetrical than their causes."", The capital importance of this statement,  perfect in its simplicity, lies in the fact that the elements of symmetry which it introduces are, related to all the phenomena of physics without exception., Guided by an exhaustive study of the groups of symmetry which might, exist in nature,  Pierre Curie showed how one should use this revelation, in character at once geometric and physical,  in order to foresee whether, a particular phenomenon can reproduce itself,  or whether its, reproduction is impossible under the given conditions. At the beginning, of a certain memoir,  he insists in these terms:, ""I think it is necessary to introduce into physics the ideas of symmetry, familiar to crystallographers."", His work in this field is fundamental,  and even though he was led away, from it later by other investigations,  he always retained a passionate, interest in the physics of crystals,  as well as in projects of further, research in this domain., The principle of symmetry to which Pierre Curie had so eagerly devoted, himself is one of the small number of great principles which dominate, the study of the phenomena of physics,  and which,  having their root in, ideas derived by experiment,  yet little by little detach themselves and, assume a form more and more general and more and more perfect. It is in, this way that the idea of the equivalence of heat and of work,  added to, the earlier notion of the equivalence of kinetic and potential energies, brought about the establishment of the principle of the conservation of, energy whose application is entirely general. In the same way the law of, the conservation of mass grew out of the experiments of Lavoisier,  which, belong to the foundations of chemistry. Recently an admirable synthesis, has made it possible for us to attain a still higher degree of, generalization through the union of these two principles,  for it has, been proved that the mass of a body is proportional to its internal, energy. The study of electrical phenomena led Lippmann to announce the, general law of the conservation of electricity. The principle of Carnot, born of considerations on the functioning of thermal machines,  has, acquired also so general a significance,  that it made possible the, foreseeing of the most probable character of spontaneous evolution for, all material systems., The principle of symmetry furnishes an example of an analogous, evolution. To begin with,  observation of Nature was able to suggest the, idea of symmetry; though such observations reveal only imperfectly any, regular dispositions in the aspects of animals and plants. The, regularity becomes very much more perfect in the case of crystallized, minerals. We may consider that Nature furnishes us the idea of a plane, of symmetry and of an axis of symmetry. An object possesses a plane of, symmetry,  or a plane of reflection,  if this plane divides the object, into two parts,  of which each one may be thought of as the image of the, other reflected in the plane as in a mirror. It is this,  approximately, that occurs in the external appearance of man and of numerous animals., An object possesses an axis of symmetry of the order, n,  if it, preserves the same appearance after a rotation on this axis of the nth, part of a revolution. Thus a regular flower of four petals has an axis, of symmetry of the order four,  or a quarternary axis. Crystals like those, of rock salt or of alum possess many planes of symmetry and many axes of, symmetry of different orders., Geometry teaches us to study the elements of symmetry of a limited, figure such,  for instance,  as a polyhedron; and to discover the, relations between its parts which permit us to reunite different, symmetries in groups. The knowledge of these groups is of the greatest, usefulness in establishing a rational classification of crystal forms in, a small number of systems each of which is derived from a simple, geometric form. Thus the regular octahedron belongs to the same system, as the cube,  for in the case of each the group formed by the axes and, the planes of symmetry is the same., In the study of the physical properties of crystalline matter it is, necessary to take account of the symmetry of such matter. This is,  in, general, anisotropic, ; that is to say,  it has not the same properties, in all directions. On the other hand,  media such as glass or water are, isotropic,  having equivalent properties in all directions. It was the, study of optics which first showed that the propagation of light in a, crystal is dependent upon the elements of symmetry in that crystal. The, same thing is true for the conduction of heat or electricity,  for, magnetization,  for polarization,  etc., It was in reflecting upon the relations between cause and effect that, govern these phenomena that Pierre Curie was led to complete and extend, the idea of symmetry,  by considering it as a condition of space, characteristic of the medium in which a given phenomenon occurs. To, define this condition it is necessary to consider not only the, constitution of the medium but also its condition of movement and the, physical agents to which it is subordinated. Thus a right circular, cylinder possesses a plane of symmetry perpendicular to its axis in its, position,  and an infinity of planes of symmetry pass through its axis., If the same cylinder is in rotation on its axis,  the first plane of, symmetry persists,  but all the others are suppressed. Furthermore,  if an, electric current traverses the cylinder lengthwise,  no plane of symmetry, remains., In every phenomenon the elements of symmetry compatible with its, existence may be determined. Certain elements can coexist with certain, phenomena,  but they are not necessary to them. That which is necessary, is that certain ones among these elements shall not exist. It is, dissymmetry, that creates the phenomenon. When several phenomena are, superposed in the same system,  the dissymmetries are added together., ""Works of Pierre Curie, "" page 127., It was from the above considerations that Pierre Curie announced the, general law whose text,  already cited,  attains the highest degree of, generalization. The synthesis thus obtained seems complete,  and all that, was further needed was to deduce from it all the developments of which, it admits., For this it is convenient to define the particular symmetry of each, phenomenon and to introduce a classification which makes clear the, principal groups of symmetry. Mass,  electric charge,  temperature,  have, the same symmetry,  of a type called, scalar,  that of the sphere. A, current of water and a rectilineal electric current have the symmetry of, an arrow,  of the type, polar vector, . The symmetry of an upright, circular cylinder is of the type, tensor, . All of the physics of, crystals can be expressed in a form in which the particular phenomena in, question are not specified,  but in which are examined only the, geometrical and analytical relations between the types of quantities, where certain ones are considered as causes and the other as effects., Thus,  the study of electrical polarization by the application of an, electric field becomes the examination of the relation between two, systems of vectors,  and the writing out of a system of linear equations, having 9 coefficients. The same system of equations holds for the, relation between an electric field and an electric current in, crystalline conductors; or for that between the temperature gradient and, the heat current,  except that the meaning of the coefficients must be, changed. Similarly,  a study of the general relations between a vector, and a system of tensors can reveal all the characteristics of, piezo-electric phenomena. And all the rich variety of the phenomena of, elasticity depends on the relation between two sets of tensors which, require,  in principle,  36 coefficients., The foregoing brief exposition reveals the high philosophic import of, these conceptions of symmetry which touch all natural phenomena,  and, whose profound significance Pierre Curie so clearly set forth. It is, interesting in this connection to recall the relation which Pasteur saw, between these same conceptions and the manifestations of life. ""The, universe, "" he said,  ""is a dissymmetric whole. I am led to believe that, life,  as it is revealed to us,  must be a function of the dissymmetry of, the universe,  or of the consequences that it involves."", As his organization of his work in the School progressed,  Pierre Curie, could begin to dream of going forward again with his experimental, research. He could do so,  however,  only under most precarious, conditions,  for he had not even a laboratory for his personal work,  nor, a room of any kind entirely at his disposition. Besides,  he possessed no, funds to support his investigations. It was only after he had been, several years at the School that he obtained,  thanks to the influence of, Schützenberger,  a small annual subvention for his work. Up to that time, the materials necessary for him were provided,  thanks to the kindness of, his superiors,  to the extent possible,  by drawing upon a very limited, general fund of the teaching laboratory. As for a place to work in,  he, had to content himself with very little. He set up certain of his, experiments in the rooms of his pupils when these were not in use. But, more frequently he worked in an outside corridor running between a, stairway and a laboratory. It was there that he conducted,  in, particular,  his long research on magnetism., This abnormal state of affairs was manifestly prejudicial to his work, but it had,  nevertheless,  the happy result of bringing his students, closer to him,  for it allowed them,  at times,  to share in his personal, scientific interests., His return to experimental research is marked by a profound study of the, ""direct reading periodic precision balance for least weights."" (1889, 1890,  1891.) In this balance,  the use of small weights is suppressed by, the employment of a microscope by means of which one reads a micrometer, attached to the extremity of one of the arms of the balance. The reading, is made when the oscillation of the balance is arrested,  which can occur, very rapidly,  thanks to the use of pneumatic dampeners conveniently, constructed. This balance marks a considerable advance over old systems., It has shown itself particularly valuable in laboratories for chemical, analysis,  where the rapidity of the weighings is frequently a test of, precision. We can say that the introduction of the Curie balances marks, an epoch in the construction of these instruments. The work done in this, field was far from empirical; it comprised a study of the theory of, damped movements and the construction of numerous curves established, with the aid of some of his students., It was toward 1891 that Pierre Curie began a long series of, investigations on the magnetic properties of bodies at divers, temperatures,  from the normal up to 1400° C. These investigations, covering years,  were presented as a Doctor's thesis before the Faculty, of Sciences of the University of Paris in 1895. In it he stated, precisely in the following few words the object and results of his work:, ""From the point of view of their magnetic properties,  bodies may be, divided into two groups:, diamagnetic, bodies,  bodies only feebly, magnetic,  and, paramagnetic, bodies., [4], At first sight the two groups, seem entirely separate. The principal aim of this research has been to, discover if there exist transitions between these two states of matter, and if it is possible to make a given body pass progressively through, them. To determine this I have examined the properties of a great number, of bodies at temperatures differing as much as possible,  in magnetic, fields of varying intensities., ""My experiments failed to prove any relation between the properties of, diamagnetic, and those of, paramagnetic, bodies., And the, results support the theories which attribute magnetism and diamagnetism, to causes of a different nature, . On the contrary,  the properties of, ferro-magnetic, bodies and of bodies, feebly magnetic, are, intimately united."", This experimental work presented many difficulties,  for it necessitated, the measuring of very minute forces (of the order of ¹⁄₁₀₀ of a, milligramme weight) within a container where the temperature could, attain 400° C., As Pierre Curie well understood,  the results he obtained are,  from a, theoretic point of view,  of fundamental importance. The Curie law, according to which the coefficient of magnetization of a body feebly, magnetized varies in inverse ratio to the absolute temperature,  is a, remarkably simple law. It is quite comparable to the Gay-Lussac law, relating to the variation of the density of a perfect gas with the, temperature. In his well known theory of magnetism P. Langevin,  in 1905, took into account the Curie law and arrived again,  theoretically,  at the, difference between the origins of diamagnetism and paramagnetism. His, work,  as well as the important investigations of P. Weiss,  demonstrated, the accuracy of Pierre Curie's conclusions,  as well as the importance of, the analogy that he perceived between the intensity of magnetization and, the density of a fluid—the paramagnetic state being comparable to a, gaseous state,  and the ferro-magnetic state to the state of, condensation., In connection with this work,  Pierre Curie spent some time in the search, for unknown phenomena whose existence did not seem, a priori, impossible to him. He sought for bodies strongly diamagnetic,  but found, none. He tried to discover,  too,  if there were bodies that acted as, conductors of magnetism,  and if magnetism can exist in a ""free state, "", like electricity. Here also the result was negative. He never published, any of these investigations,  for he had the habit of thus engaging in, the pursuit of phenomena,  often with little hope of success,  solely for, the love of the unforeseen,  and without ever thinking of publication., Because of this entirely disinterested passion for scientific research, the presentation of a doctor's thesis which would give an account of, these early investigations had never appealed to him. He was already, thirty-five years old when he decided to gather together,  in such a, thesis,  the results of his beautiful work on magnetism., I have a very vivid memory of how he sustained his thesis before the, examiners,  for he had invited me,  because of the friendship that already, existed between us,  to be present on the occasion. The jury was composed, of Professors Bonty,  Lippmann,  and Hautefeuille. In the audience were, some of his friends,  among them his aged father,  extremely happy in his, son's success. I remember the simplicity and the clarity of the, exposition,  the esteem indicated by the attitude of the professors,  and, the conversation between them and the candidate which reminded one of a, meeting of the Physics Society. I was greatly impressed; it seemed to me, that the little room that day sheltered the exaltation of human thought., In recalling this period in the life of Pierre Curie,  between 1883 and, 1895,  we can appreciate the great progress the young physicist had made, while acting as Chief of Laboratory. He had succeeded during this time, in organizing an entirely new teaching service; he had published an, important series of theoretical memoirs,  as well as the results of, experimental research of the first order. In addition,  he had, constructed new apparatus of great perfection—and all this in spite, of very insufficient accommodations and resources. This achievement, suggests the distance he had traveled since the doubts and hesitations, of his early youth in learning to discipline his methods of work,  and to, derive from them the full advantage of his exceptional capacities., He enjoyed a growing esteem in France,  and in foreign countries. He was, listened to with interest at the meetings of the learned societies, (Society of Physics,  Society of Mineralogy,  Society of Electricians), where he was in the habit of presenting his communications and where he, joined readily in the discussion of various scientific questions., Among foreign scholars who already at this time appreciated him highly, I can name,  in the first place,  the illustrious English physicist,  Lord, Kelvin,  who joined with him in a certain scientific discussion,  and who, often expressed for him,  from that time on,  both esteem and sympathy., During one of his visits to Paris,  Lord Kelvin was present at a meeting, of the Society of Physics when Pierre Curie made a statement regarding, the construction and the use of standard condensers with guard ring. In, this statement he recommended the use of an apparatus which involved the, charging of the central part of the guard ring plate by a galvanic cell, and in uniting the guard ring with the earth. One uses then,  as a, measure,  the charge induced on the second plate. Even though the, resulting disposition of lines of the field be complex,  the charge, induced can be calculated by a theorem of electrostatics,  with the same, simple formula as is used for an ordinary apparatus in a uniform field, and one has the benefit of a better isolation. Lord Kelvin believed at, first that this reasoning was inexact. Despite his great repute and his, advanced age,  he went the following day to the laboratory to find the, young Director. Here he discussed the matter with him before the, blackboard. He was completely convinced,  and seemed even delighted to, concede the point to his companion., [5], It may seem astonishing that Pierre Curie,  in spite of his merits, continued during twelve years in the small position of Chief of, Laboratory. Without doubt this was largely due to the fact that it is, easy to overlook those who have not the active support of influential, persons. It was due also to the fact that it was impossible for him to, take the many steps that the pushing of any candidature involves. Then, too,  his independence of character ill fitted him to ask for an advance, and this notwithstanding the fact that his position was very modest., Indeed his salary,  then comparable to that of a day laborer (about 300, francs a month),  was scarcely sufficient to enable him to lead the, simple life that would yet permit him to carry on his work., He expressed his feelings on this subject in the following words:, ""I have heard that perhaps one of the professors will resign,  and that I, might,  in that case,  make application to succeed him. What an ugly, necessity is this of seeking any position whatsoever; I am not, accustomed to this form of activity,  demoralizing to the highest degree., I am sorry that I spoke to you about it. I think that nothing is more, unhealthy to the spirit than to allow oneself to be occupied by things, of this character and to listen to the petty gossip that people come to, report to you."", If he disliked soliciting an advancement in position,  he was even less, inclined to hope for honors. He had,  in fact,  a very decided opinion on, the subject of honorary distinctions. Not only did he believe that they, were not helpful,  but he considered them frankly harmful. He felt that, the desire to obtain them is a cause of trouble,  and that it can degrade, the worthiest aim of man,  which is,  work for the pure love of it., Since he possessed great moral probity,  he did not hesitate to make his, acts conform to his opinions. When Schützenberger,  in order to offer, him a mark of esteem,  wished to propose him for the, Palmes, académiques, he refused this distinction,  despite the advantages which, according to general belief,  it would confer. And he wrote to his, director:, ""I have been informed that you intend to propose me again to the, prefet, for the decoration. I pray you do not do so. If you procure, for me this honor,  you will place me under the necessity of refusing it, for I have firmly decided not to accept a decoration of any kind. I hope, that you will be good enough to avoid taking a step that will make me, appear a little ridiculous in the eyes of many people. If your aim is to, offer me a testimony of your interest,  you have already done that,  and, in a very much more effective manner which touched me greatly,  for you, have made it possible for me to work without worry."", Faithful to this firm opinion,  he later declined the decoration of the, Légion d'Honneur,  which was offered him in 1903., But even though Pierre Curie refused to take steps to change his, situation it was at last improved. In 1895 the well-known physicist, Mascart,  professor in the Collège de France,  impressed with his, ability,  and with Lord Kelvin's opinion of him,  insisted that, Schützenberger create a new Chair of Physics at the School of Physics, and Chemistry. Pierre Curie was then named professor under conditions in, which his talents were duly recognized. However,  nothing was done at, this time to ameliorate the inadequate material conditions under which, as we have already seen,  he was carrying on his personal investigations., [3], In this very brief memoir is presented,  for the first time, a theory which explains why crystals develop certain faces, simultaneously,  in a particular direction,  and consequently why crystals, possess a determined form., [4], Paramagnetic, bodies are those which are magnetized in the, same manner as iron,  either strongly (, ferro-magnetic, ) or feebly., Diamagnetic, bodies are those whose very feeble magnetization is, opposed to that which iron takes in the same magnetic field., [5], The following is the text of a letter from this, distinguished savant to Pierre Curie,  written during one of his visits, to Paris:, October,  1893., ""DEAR MR. CURIE:, ""I am much obliged to you for your letter of Saturday and the, information contained in it,  which is exceedingly interesting to me., ""If I call at your laboratory between 10 and 11 tomorrow morning should, I find you there? There are two or three things I would like to speak to, you about; and I would like also to see more of your curves representing, the magnetization of iron at different temperatures., ""Yours truly, ""KELVIN."", CHAPTER IV, MARRIAGE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE FAMILY, LIFE. PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER, I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894. I, was then living in Paris where for three years I, [6], had been studying at, the Sorbonne. I had passed the examinations for the licentiate in, physics,  and was preparing for those in mathematics. At the same time I, had begun to work in the research laboratory of Professor Lippmann. A, Polish physicist whom I knew,  and who was a great admirer of Pierre, Curie,  one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and, his wife., As I entered the room,  Pierre Curie was standing in the recess of a, French window opening on a balcony. He seemed to me very young,  though, he was at that time thirty-five years old. I was struck by the open, expression of his face and by the slight suggestion of detachment in his, whole attitude. His speech,  rather slow and deliberate,  his simplicity, and his smile,  at once grave and youthful,  inspired confidence. We began, a conversation which soon became friendly. It first concerned certain, scientific matters about which I was very glad to be able to ask his, opinion. Then we discussed certain social and humanitarian subjects, which interested us both. There was,  between his conceptions and mine, despite the difference between our native countries,  a surprising, kinship,  no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral, atmosphere in which we were both raised by our families., We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked, if he might call upon me. I lived at that time in a room on the sixth, floor of a house situated near the schools. It was a poor little room, for my resources were extremely limited. I was,  nevertheless,  very happy, in it for I was now first realizing,  although already twenty-five years, old,  the ardent desire I had so long cherished of carrying on advanced, studies in science., Pierre Curie came to see me,  and showed a simple and sincere sympathy, with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his, dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research,  and, he asked me to share that life. It was not,  however,  easy for me to make, such a decision,  for it meant separation from my country and my family, and the renouncement of certain social projects that were dear to me., Having grown up in an atmosphere of patriotism kept alive by the, oppression of Poland,  I wished,  like many other young people of my, country,  to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national, spirit., So matters stood,  when at the beginning of my vacation I left Paris to, go to my father in Poland. Our correspondence during this separation, helped to strengthen the bond of affection between us., During the year 1894 Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me, admirable in their form. No one of them was very long,  for he had the, habit of concise expression,  but all were written in a spirit of, sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a, companion know him as he was. The very quality of the expression has, always seemed to me remarkable. No other one could describe in a few, lines,  as he could,  a state of mind,  or a situation,  and by the simplest, means make that description evoke a seizing image of truth. Because of, this gift,  he might,  I believe,  have been a great writer. I have already, cited a few fragments of his letters,  and others will follow. It is, appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the, possibility of our marriage:, ""We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have,  the one for the, other,  at least a great affection. Provided that you do not change your, mind! For there are no promises which hold; these are things that do not, admit of compulsion., ""It would,  nevertheless,  be a beautiful thing in which I hardly dare, believe,  to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your, dream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science., Of all these dreams,  I believe the last,  alone,  is legitimate. I mean to, say by this that we are powerless to change the social order. Even if, this were not true we should not know what to do. And in working without, understanding we should never be sure that we were not doing more harm, than good,  by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the point of, view of science,  on the contrary,  we can pretend to accomplish, something. The territory here is more solid and obvious,  and however, small it is,  it is truly in our possession., ""I strongly advise you to return to Paris in October. I shall be very, unhappy if you do not come this year,  but it is not my friend's, selfishness that makes me ask you to return. I ask it because I believe, you will work better here and that you can accomplish here something, more substantial and more useful."", One can understand,  from this letter,  that for Pierre Curie there was, only one way of looking at the future. He had dedicated his life to his, dream of science: he felt the need of a companion who could live his, dream with him. He told me many times that the reason he had not married, until he was thirty-six was because he did not believe in the, possibility of a marriage which would meet this,  his absolute necessity., When he was twenty-two years old he wrote in his diary:, ""Women,  much more than men,  love life for life's sake. Women of genius, are rare. And when,  pushed by some mystic love,  we wish to enter into a, life opposed to nature,  when we give all our thoughts to some work which, removes us from those immediately about us,  it is with women that we, have to struggle,  and the struggle is nearly always an unequal one. For, in the name of life and of nature they seek to lead us back."", We can see,  however,  in the letters I have quoted earlier,  the, unshakeable faith that Pierre Curie had in science and in its power to, further the general good of humanity. It seems appropriate to apply to, him the sentiment expressed by Pasteur in words so well known: ""I, believe invincibly that science and peace will triumph over ignorance, and war."", This confidence in the solutions of science made Pierre Curie little, inclined to take an active part in politics. He was attached,  by, education and by conviction,  to democratic and socialistic ideas,  but he, was not dominated by any party doctrine. However,  he always fulfilled, as his father did,  his obligations as a voter. In public life,  as in, private life,  he was opposed to the use of violence., ""What would you think, "" he wrote me,  ""of a person who would knock his, head against a stone wall with the intention of overthrowing it? Such an, idea might be the result of very beautiful feelings,  but in realization, it would be ridiculous and stupid. I believe that certain questions, demand a general solution,  and do not admit,  today,  of specific, solutions,  and that one who begins a course that has no issue,  may do, much harm. I believe,  further,  that justice is not of this world,  and, that the strongest system or rather the one best developed from the, economic point of view will be that which will stand. A man may exhaust, himself by work,  and yet live,  at best,  miserably. This is a revolting, fact,  but it will not,  because of that,  cease. It will disappear, probably because man is a kind of machine,  and it is of economic, advantage to make every machine work in its normal manner,  without, forcing it."", He felt the same necessity for clarity and understanding in considering, his own inner life as in examining a general problem. A great necessity, of loyalty to himself and toward others made him suffer from the, compromises imposed by life,  even though he reduced them to a minimum., ""We are all the slaves of our affections, "" he wrote,  ""slaves of the, prejudices of those we love. Besides,  we must make a living,  and this, forces us to become a wheel in the machine. The most painful are the, concessions we are forced to make to the prejudices of the society in, which we live. We must make more or fewer compromises according as we, feel ourselves feebler or stronger. If one does not make enough, concessions he is crushed; if he makes too many he is ignoble and, despises himself. I find myself far from the principles I held ten years, ago. At that time I believed it necessary to be excessive in everything, and to make no concessions whatsoever to one's environment. I believed, it necessary to exaggerate one's faults as well as one's virtues."", This was the, credo, of the man who,  without fortune himself,  desired, to share his life with that of a student also without fortune,  whom he had, met by chance., After my return from my vacation our friendship grew more and more, precious to us; each realized that he or she could find no better life, companion. We decided,  therefore,  to marry,  and the ceremony took place, in July,  1895. In conformity with our mutual wish it was the simplest, service possible, —a civil ceremony,  for Pierre Curie professed no, religion,  and I myself did not practice any. My husband's parents, received me with great cordiality,  and reciprocally my father and my, sisters,  who were present at our marriage,  were happy in knowing the, family to which I was to belong., Our first home,  an extremely simple one,  consisted of a little apartment, of three rooms in the rue de la Glacière,  not far from the School of, Physics. Its chief attraction was its view of a large garden. It was, furnished very simply with objects that had belonged to our families., Our means did not permit our having servants,  so that I had to assume, practically all the household duties,  as I had been in the habit of, doing during my student days., Professor Curie's salary was 6000 francs a year,  and we held that he, should not undertake any supplementary work,  at least in the beginning., As for myself,  I was preparing to take the examination for the, agregation, of young women,  in view of obtaining a teaching post., These I passed in 1896. We ordered our life to suit our scientific work, and our days were passed in the laboratory,  where Schützenberger, permitted that I might work with my husband., He was then engaged in a research on the growth of crystals,  which, interested him keenly. He wished to know if certain faces of a crystal, had a preferential development chiefly because they have a different, rapidity of growth or because their solubility is different. He quickly, obtained interesting results (not published) but he had to interrupt his, investigations to undertake others on radioactivity. And he often, regretted that he was never able to return to them. I was occupied at, this time with the study of the magnetization of tempered steel., The preparation of his class lectures was for Pierre Curie a genuine, care. The Chair was a new one,  and carried no prescribed course of, study. He divided his lectures,  at first,  between crystallography and, electricity. Then,  as he recognized more and more the utility of a, serious theoretical course in electricity for future engineers,  he, devoted himself entirely to this subject,  and succeeded in establishing, a course (of about 120 lectures) that was the most complete and modern, then to be had in Paris. This cost him a considerable effort,  of which I, was the daily witness; for he was always anxious to give a complete, picture of the phenomena and of the evolution of theories,  and of ideas., He was always anxious,  too,  that his mode of exposition should be clear, and precise. He thought of publishing a treatise summing up this course, but unfortunately the many preoccupations of the following years, prevented him from putting this plan into execution., We lived a very single life,  interested in common,  as we were,  in our, laboratory experiments and in the preparation of lectures and, examinations. During eleven years we were scarcely ever separated,  which, means that there are very few lines of existing correspondence between, us,  representing that period. We spent our rest days and our vacations, walking or bicycling either in the country near Paris,  or along the sea, or in the mountains. My husband was so engrossed in his researches, however,  that it was very difficult for him to remain for any length of, time in a place where he lacked facilities for work. After a few days he, would say: ""It seems to me a very long time since we have accomplished, anything."" And yet he liked the excursions which covered successive, days,  and enjoyed to the full our walks together,  just as he had, formerly enjoyed those with his brother. But his joy in seeing beautiful, things never drew his thoughts away from the scientific questions that, absorbed him. In these free times,  we traversed the region of the, Cevennes and of the Monts d'Auvergne,  as well as the coast of France, and some of its great forests., These days in the open,  filled with beautiful sights,  made a deep, impression on us,  and we loved to recall them. One of our radiant, memories was of a sunny day,  when after a long and wearying climb,  we, reached the fresh,  green meadow of the Aubrac,  in the pure air of the, high plateaus. Another vivid memory was that of an evening,  when, lingering until twilight in the gorge of the Truyère,  we were enchanted, to hear a popular air dying away in the distance,  carried to us from a, little boat that descended the stream. We had taken so little notice of, the time that we did not regain our lodging before dawn. At one point we, had an encounter with carts whose horses were frightened by our, bicycles,  and we were obliged to cut across ploughed fields. At length, we regained our route on the high plateau,  bathed in the unreal light of, the moon. And cows that were passing the night in enclosures came, gravely to contemplate us with their large,  tranquil eyes., The forest of Compiegne charmed us in the spring,  with its mass of green, foliage stretching far as the eye could see,  and its periwinkles and, anemones. On the border of the forest of Fontainebleau,  the banks of the, Loing,  covered with water buttercups,  were an object of delight for, Pierre Curie. We loved the melancholy coasts of Brittany and the reaches, of heather and gorse,  stretching to the very points of Finistère,  which, seemed like claws or teeth burying themselves in the water which forever, rages at them., Later,  when we had our baby with us,  we passed our vacations in some one, locality,  without traveling about. We lived then as simply as possible, in retired villages where we could scarcely be distinguished from the, villagers themselves. I remember the stupefaction of an American, journalist when he found us one day at Pouldu,  at a moment when I was, sitting on one of the stone steps of our house in the act of shaking the, sand from my sandals. However,  his embarrassment was short-lived and, adapting himself to the situation,  he sat down beside me and began, jotting down in his notebook my answers to his questions., The most affectionate relations existed between my husband's parents and, myself. We often went to Sceaux,  where the room my husband used to have, before our marriage was always reserved for us. I had also a very tender, affection for Jacques Curie and his family (he was married and had two, children); for Pierre's brother became mine,  and has always remained so., Our eldest daughter,  Irene,  was born in September,  1897,  and only a few, days afterwards my husband suffered a great loss in the death of his, mother. Doctor Curie came to live with us in a house which had a garden, and was situated on the old fortifications of Paris (108 Boulevard, Kellermann) near the park of Montsouris. Pierre Curie lived in this, house until the end of his life., With the birth of our child,  the difficulties of carrying on our work, were augmented: for I had to give more time to the household. Very, fortunately for us I could leave my little girl with her grandfather, who much enjoyed taking care of her. But we had to think also of, increasing our resources to meet the needs of our larger family and to, enable us to secure someone to help me in the house,  a necessity from, now on. However,  our situation remained as it was during the following, two years,  which we consecrated to intensive laboratory research on, radioactivity. It was,  indeed,  not relieved until 1900,  to the, detriment,  it is true,  of the amount of time we could give to our, investigations., All formal social obligations were excluded from our life. Pierre Curie, had for such things an unconquerable repugnance. Neither in his earlier, nor his later life would he pay visits or undertake to involve himself, in relations without special interest. By nature grave and silent,  he, preferred to abandon himself to his own reflections,  rather than to, engage in an exchange of banal words. On the other hand,  he valued, greatly his boyhood friends,  and those to whom he was bound by a common, interest in science., Among the latter,  E. Gouy,  professor of the faculty of sciences at Lyon, should be named. His friendly relations with Pierre Curie dated from the, time when they were both preparators at the Sorbonne. They carried on, regularly a scientific correspondence,  and took great pleasure in seeing, each other again during the various brief visits of E. Gouy to Paris,  on, which occasions they were inseparable. There existed also a friendship, of long standing between my husband and Ch. Ed. Guillaume,  now director, of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures of Sèvres. They met, at the Physics Society and occasionally on Sundays at Sèvres or Sceaux., Later a group of younger men formed themselves about Pierre Curie. They, were investigators engaged,  as he was,  in physical and chemical research, in the newest fields of these sciences. Among these men were André, Debierne,  my husband's intimate friend and collaborator in the work on, radioactivity; George Sagnac,  his collaborator in a study of the X-rays;, Paul Langevin,  who became a professor in the Collège de France; Jean, Perrin,  at present professor of physical chemistry in the Sorbonne; and, Georges Urbain,  student of the School of Physics and later professor in, the Sorbonne. Often one or the other came to see us in our quiet house, in the Boulevard Kellermann. Then we engaged in discussions of recent or, future experiments,  or of new ideas and theories,  and never tired of, rejoicing over the marvelous development of modern physics., There were not many large reunions in our house,  for my husband did not, feel the need of them. He was more at his ease in a conversation with, some one or few persons,  and rarely attended any meetings except those, of the scientific societies. If by chance he found himself in a, gathering where the general conversation did not interest him,  he took, refuge in a tranquil corner where he could forget the company as he, pursued his own thoughts., Our relations with our families were very restricted on his side as on, mine; for he had few relatives and mine were far away. He was,  however, very devoted to those of my family who could come to visit me in Paris, or during our vacations., In 1899,  Pierre Curie made a journey with me to the Carpathians of, Austrian Poland,  where one of my sisters,  married to Doctor Dluski and, herself a physician,  directed,  with him,  a large sanatorium. Through a, touching desire to know all that was dear to me,  my husband,  though he, knew little of foreign languages,  wished to learn Polish,  something, which I had not thought of suggesting because I did not believe it could, prove sufficiently useful to him. He felt a sincere sympathy for my, country and believed in the future Establishment of a free Poland., In our life together it was given to me to know him as he had hoped I, might,  and to penetrate each day further into his thought. He was as, much and much more than all I had dreamed at the time of our union. My, admiration of his unusual qualities grew continually; he lived on a, plane so rare and so elevated that he sometimes seemed to me a being, unique in his freedom from all vanity and from the littlenesses that one, discovers in oneself and in others,  and which one judges with indulgence, although aspiring to a more perfect ideal., In this lay,  without doubt,  the secret of that infinite charm of his to, which one could not long rest insensible. His thoughtful expression and, the directness of his look were strongly attractive and this attraction, was increased by his kindliness and gentleness of character. He, sometimes said that he never felt combative,  and this was entirely true., One could not enter into a dispute with him because he could not become, angry. ""Getting angry is not one of my strong points, "" he would say, smiling. If he had few friends,  he had no enemies; for he could not, injure anyone,  even by inadvertence. But at the same time no one could, force him to deviate from his line of action,  something which led his, father to nickname him the ""gentle stubborn one."", When he expressed his opinion he did so frankly,  for he was convinced, that diplomatic methods are puerile,  and that directness is at once, easiest and best. Because of this practice,  he acquired a certain, reputation for naïveté; in reality he was acting on a well-considered, decision,  rather than by instinct. It was perhaps because he was able to, judge himself and to retire within himself,  that he was so capable of, clearly appreciating the springs of action,  the intention,  and the, thoughts of others. And if he sometimes neglected details,  he was rarely, deceived in the essentials. Usually he kept his sure judgments to, himself; but once he had made up his mind he sometimes expressed them, without reticence,  in the assurance that he was doing something useful., In his scientific relations he showed no sharpness,  and did not permit, himself to be influenced by considerations of personal credit or by, personal sentiments. Every beautiful success gave him pleasure,  even if, achieved in a domain where he felt himself to have priority. He said:, ""What does it matter if I have not published such and such, investigations,  if another has published them?"" For he held that in, science we should be interested in things and not in persons. He was so, genuinely against every form of emulation that he opposed even the, competitions and gradings of the lycées,  as well as all forms of, honorary distinction. He never failed to give counsel and encouragement, to any of those who showed an aptitude for science,  and certain among, them still remain profoundly grateful to him., If his attitude was that of one of the élite who have attained the, highest summit of civilization,  his acts were those of a truly good man, endowed with the sentiment of human solidarity intimately bound to his, intellectual conceptions,  and full of understanding and indulgence. He, was always ready to aid,  as far as his means allowed,  any person in a, difficult situation,  even if helping meant giving some of his time, which was always the greatest sacrifice he could make. His generosity, was so spontaneous that one scarcely noticed it. He believed that the, only advantage of material means,  beyond that of providing the, necessities of a simple life,  was in the opportunity they offered of, aiding others,  and of pursuing the work of one's preference., What shall I say,  finally,  of his love for his own,  and of his qualities, as friend? His friendship,  which he gave rarely,  was sure and faithful, for it rested on a community of ideas and opinions. And still more, rarely did he give affection; but how complete was his gift to his, brother and to me! He could forsake his customary reserve for an, unconstraint which established harmony and confidence. His tenderness, was the most exquisite of blessings,  sure and helpful,  full of, gentleness and solicitude. It was good to be surrounded by this, tenderness; it was cruel to lose it after having lived in an atmosphere, completely permeated by it. But I will let his own words tell how, completely he gave himself:, ""I think of you who fill my life,  and I long for new powers. It seems to, me that in concentrating my mind exclusively upon you,  as I am doing, that I should succeed in seeing you,  and in following what you are, doing; and that I should be able to make you feel that I am altogether, yours at this moment, —but the image does not come."", We were not warranted in having great confidence in our health,  nor in, our strength so often put to severe tests. And from time to time,  as, happens to those who know the value of sharing a common life,  the fear, of the irreparable touched our minds. In such moments his simple courage, led him always to the same inevitable conclusion: ""Whatever happens, even if one should become like a body without a soul,  still one must, always work."", [6], The following are a few brief biographical details:, My name is Marie Sklodowska. My father and mother belonged to Catholic, Polish families. Both were teachers in secondary schools in Warsaw (at, that time under Russia). I was born in Warsaw and attended a lycée, there. Following the lycée,  I taught several years. Then in 1892 I came, to Paris in order to study science., CHAPTER V, THE DREAM BECOME A REALITY. THE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM, I have already said that in 1897 Pierre Curie was occupied with an, investigation on the growth of crystals. I myself had finished,  by the, beginning of vacation,  a study of the magnetization of tempered steels, which had resulted in our getting a small subvention from the Society, for the Encouragement of National Industry. Our daughter Irene was born, in September,  and as soon as I was well again,  I resumed my work in the, laboratory with the intention of preparing a doctor's thesis., Our attention was caught by a curious phenomenon discovered in 1896 by, Henri Becquerel. The discovery of the X-ray by Roentgen had excited the, imagination,  and many physicians were trying to discover if similar rays, were not emitted by fluorescent bodies under the action of light. With, this question in mind Henri Becquerel was studying uranium salts,  and, as sometimes occurs,  came upon a phenomenon different from that he was, looking for: the spontaneous emission by uranium salts of rays of a, peculiar character. This was the discovery of radioactivity., The particular phenomenon discovered by Becquerel was as follows:, uranium compound placed upon a photographic plate covered with black, paper produces on that plate an impression analogous to that which light, would make. The impression is due to uranium rays that traverse the, paper. These same rays can,  like X-rays,  discharge an electroscope,  by, making the air which surrounds it a conductor., Henri Becquerel assured himself that these properties do not depend on a, preliminary isolation,  and that they persist when the uranium compound, is kept in darkness during several months. The next step was to ask, whence came this energy,  of minute quantity,  it is true,  but constantly, given off by uranium compounds under the form of radiations., The study of this phenomenon seemed to us very attractive and all the, more so because the question was entirely new and nothing yet had been, written upon it. I decided to undertake an investigation of it., It was necessary to find a place in which to conduct the experiments. My, husband obtained from the director of the School the authorization to, use a glassed-in study on the ground floor which was then being used as, a storeroom and machine shop., Pierre and Marie Curie in their laboratory,  where radium was, discovered., Henri Manuel,  Paris., In order to go beyond the results reached by Becquerel,  it was necessary, to employ a precise quantitative method. The phenomenon that best lent, itself to measurement was the conductibility produced in the air by, uranium rays. This phenomenon,  which is called, ionization,  is, produced also by X-rays and investigation of it in connection with them, had made known its principal characteristics., For measuring the very feeble currents that one can make pass through, air ionized by uranium rays,  I had at my disposition an excellent method, developed and applied by Pierre and Jacques Curie. This method consists, in counterbalancing on a sensitive electrometer the quantity of, electricity carried by the current with that which a piezo-electric, quartz can furnish. The installation therefore required a Curie, electrometer,  a piezo-electric quartz,  and a chamber of ionization, which last was formed by a plate condenser whose higher plate was joined, to the electrometer,  while the lower plate,  charged with a known, potential,  was covered with a thin layer of the substance to be, examined. Needless to say,  the place for such an electrometric, installation was hardly the crowded and damp little room in which I had, to set it up., My experiments proved that the radiation of uranium compounds can be, measured with precision under determined conditions,  and that this, radiation is an atomic property of the element of uranium. Its intensity, is proportional to the quantity of uranium contained in the compound, and depends neither on conditions of chemical combination,  nor on, external circumstances,  such as light or temperature., I undertook next to discover if there were other elements possessing the, same property,  and with this aim I examined all the elements then known, either in their pure state or in compounds. I found that among these, bodies,  thorium compounds are the only ones which emit rays similar to, those of uranium. The radiation of thorium has an intensity of the same, order as that of uranium,  and is,  as in the case of uranium,  an atomic, property of the element., It was necessary at this point to find a new term to define this new, property of matter manifested by the elements of uranium and thorium. I, proposed the word radioactivity which has since become generally, adopted; the radioactive elements have been called radio elements., During the course of my research,  I had had occasion to examine not only, simple compounds,  salts and oxides,  but also a great number of minerals., Certain ones proved radioactive; these were those containing uranium and, thorium; but their radioactivity seemed abnormal,  for it was much, greater than the amount I had found in uranium and thorium had led me to, expect., This abnormality greatly surprised us. When I had assured myself that it, was not due to an error in the experiment,  it became necessary to find, an explanation. I then made the hypothesis that the ores uranium and, thorium contain in small quantity a substance much more strongly, radioactive than either uranium or thorium. This substance could not be, one of the known elements,  because these had already been examined; it, must,  therefore,  be a new chemical element., I had a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as, possible. And Pierre Curie,  keenly interested in the question,  abandoned, his work on crystals (provisionally,  he thought) to join me in the, search for this unknown substance., We chose,  for our work,  the ore pitchblende,  a uranium ore,  which in its, pure state is about four times more active than oxide of uranium., Since the composition of this ore was known through very careful, chemical analysis,  we could expect to find,  at a maximum,  1 per cent of, new substance. The result of our experiment proved that there were in, reality new radioactive elements in pitchblende,  but that their, proportion did not reach even a millionth per cent!, The method we employed is a, new method in chemical research based on, radioactivity, . It consists in inducing separation by the ordinary means, of chemical analysis,  and of measuring,  under suitable conditions,  the, radioactivity of all the separate products. By this means one can note, the chemical character of the radioactive element sought for,  for it, will become concentrated in those products which will become more and, more radioactive as the separation progresses. We soon recognized that, the radioactivity was concentrated principally in two different chemical, fractions,  and we became able to recognize in pitchblende the presence, of at least two new radioactive elements: polonium and radium. We, announced the existence of polonium in July,  1898,  and of radium in, December of the same year., [7], In spite of this relatively rapid progress,  our work was far from, finished. In our opinion,  there could be no doubt of the existence of, these new elements,  but to make chemists admit their existence,  it was, necessary to isolate them. Now,  in our most strongly radioactive, products (several hundred times more active than uranium),  the polonium, and radium were present only as traces. The polonium occurred associated, with bismuth extracted from pitchblende,  and radium accompanied the, barium extracted from the same mineral. We already knew by what methods, we might hope to separate polonium from bismuth and radium from barium;, but to accomplish such a separation we had to have at our disposition, much larger quantities of the primary ore than we had., It was during this period of our research that we were extremely, handicapped by inadequate conditions,  by the lack of a proper place to, work in,  by the lack of money and of personnel., Pitchblende was an expensive mineral,  and we could not afford to buy a, sufficient quantity. At that time the principal source of this mineral, was at St. Joachimsthal (Bohemia) where there was a mine which the, Austrian government worked for the extraction of uranium. We believed, that we would find all the radium and a part of the polonium in the, residues of this mine,  residues which had so far not been used at all., Thanks to the influence of the Academy of Sciences of Vienna,  we secured, several tons of these residues at an advantageous price,  and we used it, as our primary material. In the beginning we had to draw on our private, resources to pay the costs of our experiment; later we were given a few, subventions and some help from outside sources., The question of quarters was particularly serious; we did not know where, we could conduct our chemical treatments. We had been obliged to start, them in an abandoned storeroom across a court from the workroom where we, had our electrometric installation. This was a wooden shed with a, bituminous floor and a glass roof which did not keep the rain out,  and, without any interior arrangements. The only objects it contained were, some worn pine tables,  a cast-iron stove,  which worked badly,  and the, blackboard which Pierre Curie loved to use. There were no hoods to carry, away the poisonous gases thrown off in our chemical treatments,  so that, it was necessary to carry them on outside in the court,  but when the, weather was unfavorable we went on with them inside,  leaving the windows, open., A view of the extraction of radium in the old, shed where the first radium was obtained., In this makeshift laboratory we worked practically unaided during two, years,  occupying ourselves as much with chemical research as with the, study of the radiation of the increasingly active products we were, obtaining. Then it became necessary for us to divide our work. Pierre, Curie continued the investigations on the properties of radium,  while I, went ahead with the chemical experiments which had as their objective, the preparation of pure radium salts. I had to work with as much as, twenty kilogrammes of material at a time,  so that the hangar was filled, with great vessels full of precipitates and of liquids. It was, exhausting work to move the containers about,  to transfer the liquids, and to stir for hours at a time,  with an iron bar,  the boiling material, in the cast-iron basin. I extracted from the mineral the radium-bearing, barium and this,  in the state of chloride,  I submitted to a fractional, crystallization. The radium accumulated in the least soluble parts,  and, I believed that this process must lead to the separation of the chloride, of radium. The very delicate operations of the last crystallizations, were exceedingly difficult to carry out in that laboratory,  where it was, impossible to find protection from the iron and coal dust. At the end of, a year,  results indicated clearly that it would be easier to separate, radium than polonium; that is why we concentrated our efforts in this, direction. We examined the radium salts we obtained with the aim of, discovering their powers and we loaned samples of the salts to several, scientists, [8], in particular to Henri Becquerel., During the years 1899 and 1900,  Pierre Curie published with me a memoir, on the discovery of the induced radioactivity produced by radium. We, published another paper on the effects of the rays: the luminous, effects,  the chemical effects,  etc.; and still another on the electric, charge carried by certain of the rays. And,  finally,  we made a general, report on the new radioactive substances and their radiations,  for the, Congress of Physics which met in Paris in 1900. My husband published, besides,  a study of the action of a magnetic field on radium rays., Pierre Curie with the quartz piezo-electroscope, he invented,  by which rays of radium are measured., The main result of our investigations and of those of other scientists, during these years,  was to make known the nature of the rays emitted by, radium,  and to prove that they belonged to three different categories., Radium emits a stream of active corpuscles moving with great speed., Certain of them carry a positive charge and form the Alpha rays; others, much smaller,  carry a negative charge and form Beta rays. The movements, of these two groups are influenced by a magnet. A third group is, constituted by the rays that are insensible to the action of a magnet, and that,  we know to-day,  are a radiation similar to light and to, X-rays., We had an especial joy in observing that our products containing, concentrated radium were all spontaneously luminous. My husband who had, hoped to see them show beautiful colorations had to agree that this, other unhoped-for characteristic gave him even a greater satisfaction, than that he had aspired to., The Congress of 1900 offered us an opportunity to make known,  at closer, range,  to foreign scientists,  our new radioactive bodies. This was one, of the points on which the interest of this Congress chiefly centered., We were at this time entirely absorbed in the new field that opened, before us,  thanks to the discovery so little expected. And we were very, happy in spite of the difficult conditions under which we worked. We, passed our days at the laboratory,  often eating a simple student's lunch, there. A great tranquillity reigned in our poor,  shabby hangar;, occasionally,  while observing an operation,  we would walk up and down, talking of our work,  present and future. When we were cold,  a cup of hot, tea,  drunk beside the stove,  cheered us. We lived in a preoccupation as, complete as that of a dream., Sometimes we returned in the evening after dinner for another survey of, our domain. Our precious products,  for which we had no shelter,  were, arranged on tables and boards; from all sides we could see their, slightly luminous silhouettes,  and these gleamings,  which seemed, suspended in the darkness,  stirred us with ever new emotion and, enchantment., Actually,  the employees of the School owed Pierre Curie no service. But, nevertheless the laboratory helper whom he had had to aid him when he, was laboratory chief had always continued to help him as much as he, could in the time at his disposal. This good man,  whose name was Petit, felt a real affection and solicitude for us,  and many things were made, easier because of his good will and the interest he took in our success., A view of the extraction of radium in the old, shed where the first radium was obtained., We had begun our research in radioactivity quite alone,  but because of, the magnitude of the undertaking,  we were more and more convinced of the, utility of inviting collaboration. Already in 1898,  one of the, laboratory chiefs of the School,  G. Bemont,  had given us temporary aid., And toward 1900 Pierre Curie associated with him a young chemist,  André, Debierne,  preparator under Friedel,  who held him in high esteem. André, Debierne gladly accepted Pierre Curie's proposal that he occupy himself, with the investigation of radioactivity; and he undertook,  in, particular,  the search for a new radio element,  which we suspected, existed in the iron group and in rare earths. He discovered the element, actinium. Even though he carried on his work in the laboratory of, physical chemistry at the Sorbonne,  directed by Jean Perrin,  he, frequently came to visit us in our storeroom,  and was soon an intimate, friend of ours,  and of Doctor Curie and the children., About this same time,  George Sagnac,  a young physicist engaged in the, study of X-rays,  often came to discuss with my husband the analogies one, could expect to find between these rays,  and their secondary rays,  and, the radiations of radioactive bodies. They worked together on the, investigation of the electric charge carried by the secondary rays., Besides our collaborators we saw very few persons in the laboratory;, however,  from time to time some physicist or chemist came to see our, experiments,  or to ask Pierre Curie for advice or information; for his, authority in several branches of physics was very well recognized. And, then there were discussions before the blackboard, —discussions which, are pleasantly remembered to-day,  because they stimulated an interest in, science and an ardor for work without interrupting any course of, reflection,  and without troubling that atmosphere of peace and, contemplation which is the true atmosphere of the laboratory., [7], This last publication was issued in common with G., Bemont,  who had collaborated with us in our experiments., [8], I quote,  as an example,  a letter addressed to Pierre Curie, by A. Paulsen,  thanking him for radioactive products loaned him in 1899:, ""Den Damke Nordl's Expedition, Akureyi,  16 Oct. 1899., Monsieur,  and most honored colleague, ""I thank you warmly for your letter of August 1,  which I have just, received in the north of Iceland., ""We have abandoned all the methods hitherto employed to establish in a, fixed conductor the potential that exists at certain points in the mass, of air that surrounds it,  and are using only your radiant powder., ""Accept,  Monsieur,  and most honored colleague,  my respectful salutations, and my renewed thanks for the great services you have rendered my, expedition., ""ADAM PAULSEN."", CHAPTER VI, THE STRUGGLE FOR MEANS TO WORK. THE, BURDEN OF CELEBRITY. THE FIRST ASSISTANCE, FROM THE STATE. IT COMES TOO LATE, In spite of our desire to concentrate our entire effort on the work in, which we were engaged,  and in spite of the fact that our needs were so, modest,  we were forced to recognize,  toward 1900,  that some increase in, our income was indispensable. Pierre Curie had few illusions about his, chances of obtaining an important chair in the University of Paris, which would,  even though it meant no large salary,  have sufficed for the, small needs of our family,  and enabled us to live without a, supplementary revenue. Since he was neither a graduate of the Normal, School nor of the Polytechnic,  he lacked the support,  often decisive, which these big schools give their pupils; and the posts to which he, might justly have aspired,  because of his achievements,  were given to, others,  without anyone's even thinking of him as a possible candidate., At the beginning of 1898,  he asked,  without success,  for the Chair of, Physical Chemistry left vacant by the death of Salet,  and this failure, convinced him that he had no chance of advancement. He was appointed, however,  in March,  1900,  to the position of assistant professor, (, répétiteur, ) in the Polytechnic School,  but he kept his post only, six months., In the spring of 1900,  there came an unexpected offer,  that of the Chair, of Physics in the University of Geneva. The doyen of that University, made the invitation in the most cordial manner,  and insisted that the, University was ready to make an exceptional effort to secure a scientist, of such high repute. The advantages of this position were that the, salary was larger than the average one,  that it carried the promise of, the development of a Physics Laboratory adequate to our needs,  and that, an official position for me would be provided in this laboratory. Such a, proposition merited a most careful consideration,  so we made a visit to, the University of Geneva,  where our reception was the most encouraging, possible., This was a grave decision for us to make. Geneva presented material, advantages,  and the opportunity of a life comparable in its tranquillity, with that in the country. Pierre Curie was,  therefore,  tempted to, accept,  and it was only our immediate interest in our researches in, radium that made him finally decide not to. He feared the interruption, of our investigations which such a change must involve., At this moment the Chair of Physics in the physics,  chemistry and, natural history course at the Sorbonne,  obligatory for students of, medicine,  and familiarly known as P.C.N.,  was vacant; he applied,  and, was appointed,  due to the influence of Henri Poincaré,  who was anxious, to free him from the necessity of quitting France. At the same time I, was given charge of the physics lectures in the Normal School for Girls, at Sèvres., So we remained in Paris,  and with our income increased. But we were at, the same time working under increasingly difficult conditions. Pierre, Curie was doing double teaching; and that in the P.C.N.,  with its very, large number of students,  fatigued him greatly. As for myself,  I had to, give much time to the preparation of my lectures at Sèvres,  and to the, organization of the laboratory work there,  which I found very, insufficient., Moreover,  Pierre Curie's new position did not bring with it a, laboratory; a little office and a single work room were all that he had, at his disposition in the annex (12 rue Cuvier) of the Sorbonne,  which, served as teaching quarters for the P.C.N. And yet he felt it absolutely, necessary to go ahead with his own work. In fact,  the rapid extension of, his investigations in radioactivity had made him determine that in his, new position at the Sorbonne he would receive students and start them in, research. He therefore took steps to find larger available working, quarters. Those who have taken similar steps realize the wall of, financial and administrative obstacles against which he was throwing, himself,  and realize the large number of official letters,  visits,  and, of requests the least success entailed. All this thoroughly wearied and, discouraged Pierre Curie. He was obliged,  too,  constantly,  to keep, traveling back and forth between the laboratories of the P.C.N. and the, hangar of the School of Physics where we still continued our work., And besides these difficulties,  we found that we could not make further, progress without the aid of industrial means of treating our raw, material. Fortunately certain expedients and generous assistance solved, this question., As early as 1899 Pierre Curie succeeded in organizing a first industrial, experiment,  using for it a chance installation placed at his disposition, by the Central Society of Chemical Products,  with which he had had, relations in connection with the construction of his balances. The, technical details had been arranged very successfully by André, Debierne,  and the operations brought good results,  even though it had, been necessary to train a special personnel for this chemical work which, demanded special precautions., Our investigations had started a general scientific movement,  and, similar work was being undertaken in other countries. Toward these, efforts Pierre Curie maintained a most disinterested and liberal, attitude. With my agreement he refused to draw any material profit from, our discovery. We took no copyright,  and published without reserve all, the results of our research,  as well as the exact processes of the, preparation of radium. In addition,  we gave to those interested whatever, information they asked of us. This was of great benefit to the radium, industry,  which could thus develop in full freedom,  first in France, then in foreign countries,  and furnish to scientists and to physicians, the products which they needed. This industry still employs to-day,  with, scarcely any modifications,  the processes indicated by us., [9], Even though our industrial experiment yielded good results,  again our, slender resources made it difficult to make further progress. Inspired, by our attempt,  a French industrial,  Armet de Lisle,  had the idea,  which, seemed daring at that epoch,  of founding a veritable radium factory that, would furnish this product to physicians,  whose interest in the, biological effects of radium and its possible therapeutic applications, had been aroused by the publication of various investigations. The, project proved a success because he could employ men already trained by, us in the delicate processes of this manufacture. Radium was then, regularly placed on sale,  at a high price,  it is true,  because of the, special conditions under which it had to be made,  and because,  too,  of, the immediate rise in the cost of the minerals necessary to its, production., [10], I should like to express,  here,  our appreciation of the spirit in which, Armet de Lisle offered to cooperate with us. In an entirely, disinterested manner he placed at our disposition a little working place, in his factory and a part of the means necessary for us to use it. Other, funds were added either by ourselves,  or came through subventions,  of, which the most important,  accorded in 1902 by the Academy of Sciences, amounted to 20, 000 francs., It was in this way that we were able to utilize the ore we had acquired, little by little in the preparation of a certain quantity of radium, which we used constantly in our research. The radium-bearing barium was, extracted in the factory,  and I carried on its purification and, fractional crystallization in the laboratory. In 1902 I succeeded in, preparing a decigramme of chloride of pure radium which gave only the, spectrum of the new element,  radium. I made a first determination of the, atomic weight of this new element,  an atomic weight much higher than, that of barium. Thus the chemical individuality of radium was completely, established,  and the reality of radioelements was a known fact about, which there could be no further controversy., I based my doctor's thesis,  presented in 1903,  on these investigations., Later,  the quantity of radium extracted for the laboratory was, increased,  and in 1907 I was able to make a second and more precise, determination of the atomic weight as 225.35—one accepts now the, number 226. I succeeded,  too,  jointly with André Debierne,  in obtaining, radium in the state of metal. The total quantity of radium I prepared, and gave to the laboratory,  in agreement with Pierre Curie's desire, amounted to more than a gramme of radium element., The activity of pure radium exceeded all our expectations. For equal, weights this substance emits a radiation more than a million times more, intense than uranium. To offset this,  the quantity of radium contained, in uranium minerals is scarcely more than three decigrammes of radium to, the ton of uranium. There is a very close relation between these two, substances. In fact,  we know to-day that radium is produced in the, minerals at the expense of uranium., The years that followed his nomination to the P.C.N. were hard for, Pierre Curie. He had to face the many anxieties incident to the, organization of a complicated system of work when his happiness depended, on his being able to concentrate his efforts on a single determined, subject. The physical fatigue due to the numerous courses he was obliged, to give was so great that he suffered from attacks of acute pain,  which, in his overtaxed condition became more and more frequent., It was therefore vitally important,  if he was to spare his energy and, keep his health,  that the burden of his professional duties be, lightened. He decided to apply for the Chair of Mineralogy,  which was, vacant,  at the Sorbonne,  for which he was entirely qualified because of, his profound knowledge and his important publications on the theories of, the physics of crystals. Yet his candidacy failed., During this painful period he nevertheless managed,  by a truly, superhuman effort,  successfully to complete and publish several, investigations that he had made either alone or in collaboration:, Investigations on induced radioactivity (in collaboration, with A. Debierne)., Investigations on the same subject (in collaboration, with J. Danne)., Investigations on the conductibility provoked in, dielectric liquids by the rays of radium, and the Roentgen rays., Investigations on the law of the decrease of the, emanation of radium and on the radioactive, constants that characterize this emanation, and its active deposit., Discovery of the liberation of heat produced by, radium (in collaboration with A. Laborde)., Investigations on the diffusion of the emanation of, radium in the air (in collaboration with J., Danne)., Investigation on the radioactivity of gases from, thermal springs (in collaboration with A., Laborde)., Investigation on the physiological effects of, radium rays (in common with Henri Becquerel)., Investigation on the physiological action of the, radium emanation (in common with Bouchard, and Balthazard)., Notes on the apparatus for the determination of, magnetic constants (in common with C. Cheneveau)., All these investigations in radioactivity are fundamental and touch very, varied subjects. Several have as their aim the study of the emanation, that strange gaseous body that radium produces and which is largely, responsible for the intense radiation commonly attributed to the radium, itself. Pierre Curie demonstrated by a searching examination the, rigorous and invariable law according to which the emanation destroys, itself,  no matter what the conditions are in which it finds itself., To-day the emanation of radium,  harvested in tiny phials,  is commonly, employed by physicians as a therapeutic agent. Technical considerations, make its employment preferable to the direct use of radium,  and in this, case no physician can proceed without consulting the numerical chart, which tells how much of this emanation has disappeared each day,  despite, the fact that it is cloistered in its little glass prison. It is this, same emanation that is found in small quantities in mineral waters,  and, that plays a part in their curative effects., More striking still was the discovery of the discharge of heat from, radium. Without any alteration in appearance this substance releases, each hour a quantity of heat sufficient to melt its own weight of ice., When well protected against this external loss,  radium heats itself. Its, temperature can rise 10 degrees or more above that of the surrounding, atmosphere. This defied all contemporary scientific experience., Finally,  I cannot pass in silence,  because of their various, repercussions,  the experiments connected with the physiological effects, of radium., In order to test the results that had just been announced by F. Giesel, Pierre Curie voluntarily exposed his arm to the action of radium during, several hours. This resulted in a lesion resembling a burn,  that, developed progressively and required several months to heal. Henri, Becquerel had by accident a similar burn as a result of carrying in his, vest pocket a glass tube containing radium salt. He came to tell us of, this evil effect of radium,  exclaiming in a manner at once delighted and, annoyed: ""I love it,  but I owe it a grudge!"", Since he realized the interest in these physiological effects of radium, Pierre Curie undertook,  in collaboration with physicians,  the, investigations to which I have just referred,  submitting animals to the, action of radium emanation. These studies formed the point of departure, in radium therapy. The first attempts at treatment with radium were made, with products loaned by Pierre Curie,  and had as their object the cure, of lupus and other skin lesions. Thus radium therapy,  an important, branch of medicine,  and frequently designated as, Curietherapie,  was, born in France,  and was developed first through the investigations of, French physicians (Danlos,  Oudin,  Wickham,  Dominici,  Cheron,  Degrais, and others)., [11], In the meantime the great impetus given to the study of radioactivity, abroad led to a rapid succession of new discoveries. Many scientists, engaged in the search for other radio elements,  using the new method of, chemical analysis,  with the aid of radiation,  that we had inaugurated., Thus were found the mesothorium now used by physicians and manufactured, industrially,  radio-thorium,  ionium,  protoactinium,  radio-lead,  and, other substances. At present we know,  in all,  about thirty radio, elements (among which three are gases,  or emanations),  but among them, all radium still plays the most important part,  because of the great, intensity of its radiation,  which diminishes only extremely slowly, during the course of years., The year 1903 was especially important in the development of the new, science. In this year the investigation of radium,  the new chemical, element,  was achieved,  and Pierre Curie demonstrated the astonishing, discharge of heat by this element,  which nevertheless remained unaltered, in appearance. In England,  Ramsay and Soddy announced a great discovery., They proved that radium continually produces helium gas and under, conditions that force one to believe in an atomic transformation. If, indeed,  radium salt heated to its melting point is confined for some, time in a sealed glass tube,  entirely emptied of air,  one can,  in, reheating it,  make it throw off a small quantity of helium,  easy to, measure and to recognize from the character of its spectrum. This, fundamental experiment has received numerous confirmations. It furnished, us the first example of a transformation of atoms,  independent,  it is, true,  of our will,  but at the same time it reduces to nothing the theory, of the absolute fixity of the atomic edifice., All these facts,  along with others formerly known,  were made the object, of a synthesis of the highest value,  in a work by E. Rutherford and F., Soddy,  who proposed a theory of radioactive transformations,  to-day, universally adopted. According to this theory,  each radio element,  even, when it appears unchanged,  is undergoing a spontaneous transformation, and the more rapid the transformation,  the more intense is the, radiation., [12], A radioactive atom can transform itself in two ways: it can expel from, itself an atom of helium,  which,  thrown off at an enormous speed and, with a positive charge,  constitutes an Alpha ray. Or,  instead,  it can, detach from its structure a much smaller fragment,  one of those, electrons to which we have become accustomed in modern physics,  and, whose mass,  1800 times smaller than that of an atom of hydrogen when its, speed is moderate,  grows excessively when its speed approaches that of, light. These electrons,  which carry a negative charge,  form the Beta, rays. Whatever the detached fragment,  the residual atom no longer, resembles the primitive atom. Thus when the atom of radium has expelled, an atom of helium,  the residue is an atom of gaseous emanation. This, residue changes in its turn,  and the process is not arrested until the, attainment of a last residue which is stable and does not give off any, radiation. This stable matter is inactive matter., Thus the Alpha and Beta rays result from the fragmentation of atoms., Gamma-rays are a radiation analogous to light,  which accompanies the, cataclysm of the atomic transformation. They are very penetrating,  and, are the ones most used in the therapeutic methods so far developed., [13], We can see in all this that radio elements form families,  in which each, member derives from a preceding member by direct descent the primary, elements being uranium and thorium. We can in particular prove that, radium is a descendant of uranium,  and that polonium is a descendant of, radium. Since each radio element,  at the same time that it is formed by, the mother substance,  destroys itself,  it cannot accumulate in the, presence of this mother substance beyond a determined proportion,  which, explains why the relation between radium and uranium remains constant in, the very ancient unaltered minerals., The spontaneous destruction of radio elements takes place according to a, fundamental law,  called the, exponential law,  according to which the, quantity of each radio element diminishes by one-half in a time always, the same,  called a period,  this time-period making it possible to, determine without ambiguity the element under consideration. These, periods,  which can be measured by diverse methods,  vary greatly. The, period of uranium is several billions of years; that of radium is about, 1600 years; that of its emanation a little less than four days; and, there are among the following descendants some whose period is the small, fraction of a second. The exponential law has a profound philosophic, bearing; it indicates that the transformation is produced according to, the laws of probability. The causes that determine the transformation, are a mystery to us,  and we do not yet know if they derive from causal, conditions outside the atom,  or from conditions of internal instability., In many cases,  up to the present,  no exterior action has shown itself, effective in influencing the transformation., This rapid succession of discoveries which overthrew familiar scientific, conceptions long held in physics and chemistry did not fail to meet,  at, first,  with doubts and incredulity. But the great part of the scientific, world received them with enthusiasm. At the same time Pierre Curie's, fame grew in France and in foreign countries. Already in 1901 the, Academy of Sciences had awarded him the Lacaze prize. In 1902,  Mascart, who had many times given him most valuable aid,  decided to propose him, as a member of the Academy of Sciences. It was not easy for Pierre Curie, to agree to this,  believing,  as he did,  that the Academy should elect, its members without the necessity of any preliminary solicitation or, paying of calls. Nevertheless,  because of the friendly insistence of, Mascart,  and above all because the Physics Section of the Academy had, already declared itself unanimously in his favor,  he presented himself., In spite of this,  however,  he failed of election,  and it was only in, 1905 that he became a member of the Institute,  a membership which did, not last even a year. He was also elected to several academies and, scientific societies in other countries,  and given an honorary doctor's, degree by several universities., During 1903 we went to London at the invitation of the Royal, Institution,  before which my husband was to lecture on radium. On this, occasion he had a most enthusiastic reception. He was especially happy, to see here again Lord Kelvin,  who had always expressed an affection for, him,  and who,  despite his advanced age,  preserved an interest, perennially young,  in science. The illustrious scientist showed,  with, touching satisfaction,  a glass vial containing a grain of radium salt, that Pierre Curie had given him. We met here also other celebrated, scientists,  as Crookes,  Ramsay,  and J. Dewar. In collaboration with the, latter,  Pierre Curie published investigations on the discharge of heat, by radium at very low temperatures,  and upon the formation of helium in, radium salt., A few months later the Davy medal was conferred upon him (and also upon, me) by the Royal Society of London,  and at almost the same time,  we, received,  together with Henri Becquerel,  the Nobel prize for physics., Our health prevented us from attending the ceremony for the awarding of, this prize in December,  and it was only in June,  1905,  that we were able, to go to Stockholm where Pierre Curie gave his Nobel lecture. We were, most cordially received and had the felicity of seeing the admirable, Swedish nature in its most brilliant aspect., The award of the Nobel prize was an important event for us because of, the prestige carried by the Nobel foundation,  only recently founded, (1901). Also,  from a financial point of view,  the half of the prize, represented an important sum. It meant that in the future Pierre Curie, could turn over his teaching in the School of Physics to Paul Langevin, one of his former students,  and a physicist of great competence. He, could also engage a preparator to aid him in his work., But at the same time the publicity this very happy event entailed bore, very heavily on a man who was neither prepared for it,  nor accustomed to, it. There followed an avalanche of visits,  of letters,  of demands for, articles and lectures,  which meant a constant enervation,  fatigue,  and, loss of time. He was kind and did not like to refuse a request; but on, the other hand,  he had to recognize that he could not accede to the, solicitations that overwhelmed him without disastrous results to his, health,  as well as to his peace of mind,  and his work. In a letter to, Ch. Ed. Guillaume,  he said:, ""People ask me for articles and lectures,  and after a few years are, passed,  the very persons who make these demands will be astonished to, see that we have not accomplished any work."", And in other letters of the same period,  written to E. Gouy,  he, expressed himself as follows:, ""20 March 1902, ""As you have seen,  fortune favors us at this moment; but these favors of, fortune do not come without many worries. We have never been less, tranquil than at this moment. There are days when we scarcely have time, to breathe. And to think that we dreamed of living in the wild,  quite, removed from human beings!"", ""22 January 1904, ""MY DEAR FRIEND:, ""I have wanted to write to you for a long time; excuse me if I have not, done so. The cause is the stupid life which I lead at present. You have, seen this sudden infatuation for radium,  which has resulted for us in, all the advantages of a moment of popularity. We have been pursued by, journalists and photographers from all countries of the world; they have, gone even so far as to report the conversation between my daughter and, her nurse,  and to describe the black-and-white cat that lives with, us.... Further,  we have had a great many appeals for money.... Finally, the collectors of autographs,  snobs,  society people,  and even at times, scientists,  have come to see us—in our magnificent and tranquil, quarters in the laboratory—and every evening there has been a, voluminous correspondence to send off. With such a state of things I, feel myself invaded by a kind of stupor. And yet all this turmoil will, not perhaps have been in vain,  if it results in my getting a chair and, a laboratory. To tell the truth,  it will be necessary to create the, chair,  and I shall not have the laboratory at first. I should have, preferred the reverse,  but Liard wishes to take advantage of the present, moment to bring about the creation of a new chair that will later be, acquired for the university. They are to establish a chair without a, fixed program,  which will be something like a course in the Collège de, France,  and I believe I shall be obliged to change my subject each year, which will be a great trial to me."", ""31 January 1905, ""... I have had to give up going to Sweden. We are,  as you see,  most, irregular in our relations with the Swedish Academy; but,  to tell the, truth,  I can only keep up by avoiding all physical fatigue. And my wife, is in the same condition; we can no longer dream of the great work days, of times gone by., ""As to research,  I am doing nothing at present. With my course,  my, students,  apparatus to install,  and the interminable procession of, people who come to disturb me without serious reason,  the days pass, without my having been able to achieve anything useful at this end."", ""25 July 1905, ""MY DEAR FRIEND:, ""We have regretted so much being deprived of your visit this year,  but, hope to see you in October. If we do not make an effort from time to, time,  we end by losing touch with our best and most congenial friends, and in keeping company with others for the simple reason that it is easy, to meet them., ""We continue to lead the same life of people who are extremely occupied, without being able to accomplish anything interesting. It is now more, than a year since I have been able to engage in any research,  and I have, no moment to myself. Clearly I have not yet discovered a means to defend, ourselves against this frittering away of our time which is nevertheless, extremely necessary. Intellectually,  it is a question of life or death."", ""7 November 1905, ""I begin my course tomorrow but under very bad conditions for the, preparation of my experiments. The lecture room is at the Sorbonne,  and, my laboratory is in the rue Cuvier. Besides,  a great number of other, courses are given in the same lecture room,  and I can use it only one, morning for the preparation of my own., ""I am neither very well,  nor very ill; but I am easily fatigued,  and I, have left but very little capacity for work. My wife,  on the contrary, leads a very active life,  between her children,  the School at Sèvres, and the laboratory. She does not lose a minute,  and occupies herself, more regularly than I can with the direction of the laboratory in which, she passes the greater part of the day."", To sum up: despite these outside complications,  our life,  by a common, effort of will,  remained as simple and as retired as formerly. Toward, the close of 1904 our family was increased by the birth of a second, daughter. Eve Denise was born in the modest house in Boulevard, Kellermann,  where we still lived with Doctor Curie,  seeing only a few, friends., As our elder daughter grew up,  she began to be a little companion to her, father,  who took a lively interest in her education and gladly went for, walks with her in his free times,  especially on his vacation days. He, carried on serious conversations with her,  replying to all her questions, and delighting in the progressive development of her young mind. From, their early age,  his children enjoyed his tender affection,  and he never, wearied of trying to understand these little beings,  in order to be able, to give them the best he had to give., With his great success in other countries,  the complete appreciation of, Pierre Curie in France,  however tardily,  did at last follow. At, forty-five he found himself in the first rank of French scientists and, yet,  as a teacher,  he occupied an inferior position. This abnormal state, of affairs aroused public opinion in his favor,  and under the influence, of this wave of feeling,  the director of the Academy of Paris,  L. Liard, asked Parliament to create a new professorship in the Sorbonne,  and at, the beginning of the academic year 1904-05 Pierre Curie was named, titular professor of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris. A year later he, definitely quitted the School of Physics where his substitute,  Paul, Langevin,  succeeded him., This new professorship was not established without a few difficulties., The first project had provided for a new chair,  but not for a, laboratory. And Pierre Curie felt that he could not accept a situation, which involved the risk of losing even the mediocre means of work that, he then had,  instead of offering better ones. He wrote,  therefore,  to, his chiefs,  that he had decided to remain at the P.C.N. His firmness won, the day. To the new chair was added a fund for a laboratory and, personnel for the new work (a chief of laboratory,  a preparator,  and a, laboratory boy). The position of chief of laboratory was offered to me, which was a cause of very great satisfaction to my husband., It was not without regret that we left the School of Physics,  where we, had known such happy work days,  despite their attendant difficulties. We, had become particularly attached to our hangar,  which continued to, stand,  though in a state of increasing decay,  for several years,  and we, went to visit it from time to time. Later it had to be pulled down to, make way for a new building for the Physics School,  but we have, preserved photographs of it. Warned of its approaching destruction by, the faithful Petit,  I made my last pilgrimage there,  alas,  alone. On the, blackboard there was still the writing of him who had been the soul of, the place; the humble refuge for his research was all impregnated with, his memory. The cruel reality seemed some bad dream; I almost expected, to see the tall figure appear,  and to hear the sound of the familiar, voice., Even though Parliament had voted the creation of a new chair,  it did not, go so far as to consider the simultaneous founding of a laboratory which, was,  nevertheless,  necessary to the development of the new science of, radioactivity. Pierre Curie therefore kept the little workroom at the, P.C.N.,  and secured as a temporary solution of his difficulty the use of, a large room,  then not being used by the P.C.N. He arranged,  too,  to, have a little building consisting of two rooms and a study set up in the, court., One cannot help feeling sorrow in realizing that this was a last, concession,  and that actually one of the first French scientists never, had an adequate laboratory to work in,  and this even though his genius, had revealed itself as early as his twentieth year. Without doubt if he, had lived longer,  he would have had the benefit of satisfactory, conditions for his work,  but he was still deprived of them at his death, at the premature age of forty-eight. Can we fully imagine the regret of, an enthusiastic and disinterested worker in a great work,  who is, retarded in the realization of his dream by the constant lack of means?, And can we think without a feeling of profound grief of the waste—the, one irreparable one—of the nation's greatest asset: the genius,  the, powers,  and the courage of its best children?, Pierre Curie had always in mind his urgent need for a good laboratory., When,  because of his great reputation,  his chiefs felt obliged to try to, induce him,  in 1903,  to accept the decoration of the Légion d'Honneur, he declined that distinction,  remaining true to the opinion already, referred to in a preceding chapter. And the letter he wrote on this, occasion was inspired by the same feeling as that in the one previously, quoted,  when he wrote to his director to refuse the, palmes, académiques, . I quote an extract:, ""I pray you to thank the Minister,  and to inform him that I do not in, the least feel the need of a decoration,  but that I do feel the greatest, need for a laboratory."", After he was named professor at the Sorbonne,  Pierre Curie had to, prepare a new course. The position had been given a very personal, character and a very general scope. He was left great freedom in the, choice of the matter he would present. Taking advantage of this freedom, he returned to a subject that was dear to him,  and devoted part of his, lectures to the laws of symmetry,  the study of fields of vectors and, tensors,  and to the application of these ideas to the physics of, crystals. He intended to carry these lessons further,  and to work out a, course that would completely cover the physics of crystallized matter, which would have been especially useful because this subject was so, little known in France. His other lessons dealt with radioactivity,  set, forth the discoveries made in this new domain,  and the revolution they, had caused in science., Even though he was very much absorbed in the preparation of his course, and often ill,  my husband continued,  nevertheless,  to work in the, laboratory,  which was becoming better and better organized. He had a, little more space now,  and could receive a few students. In, collaboration with A. Laborde,  he carried on investigations in mineral, waters and gases discharged from springs. This was the last work he, published., His intellectual faculties were at this time at their height. One could, but admire the surety and rigor of his reasoning on the theories of, physics,  his clear comprehension of fundamental principles,  and a, certain profound sense of phenomena which he had by instinct,  but which, he perfected during the course of a life entirely consecrated to, research and reflection. His skill in experiment,  remarkable from the, beginning,  was increased by practice. He experienced the pleasure of an, artist when he succeeded with a delicate installation. He enjoyed,  too, devising and constructing new apparatus,  and I used jokingly to tell him, that he would not be happy unless he made at least an attempt of this, kind once every six months. His natural curiosity and vivid imagination, pushed him to undertakings in very varied directions; he could change, the object of his research with surprising ease., He was scrupulously careful of scientific probity and of complete, accuracy in his publications. These are very perfect in form,  and none, the less so in those parts where he applies the critical spirit to, himself,  expressing his determination never to affirm anything that does, not seem entirely clear. He expresses his thought on this point in the, following words:, ""In the study of unknown phenomena,  one can make very general hypotheses, and then advance step by step with the help of experience. This method, of progress is sure but necessarily slow. One can,  on the contrary,  make, daring hypotheses in which he specifies the mechanism of phenomena. Such, a method of procedure has the advantage of suggesting certain, experiments,  and,  above all,  of facilitating reasoning by rendering it, less abstract through the employment of an image. But on the other hand, one cannot hope thus to conceive a complex theory in accord with, experiment. The precise hypothesis almost certainly includes a portion, of error along with a portion of truth. And this last portion,  if it, exists,  forms only a part of a more general proposition to which it will, be necessary in the end to return."", Moreover,  even though he never hesitated to make hypotheses,  he never, permitted their premature publication. He could never accustom himself, to a system of work which involved hasty publications,  and was always, happier in a domain in which but a few investigators were quietly, working. The considerable vogue of radioactivity made him wish to, abandon this field of research for a time,  and to return to his, interrupted studies of the physics of crystals. He dreamed also of, making an examination of diverse theoretical questions., He gave much thought to his teaching,  which constantly improved,  and, which suggested to him ideas on the general orientation of studies and, on methods of teaching,  which he believed should be based on contact, with experience and nature. He hoped to see his views adopted by the, Association of Professors as soon as it was formed,  and to obtain the, declaration ""that the teaching of the sciences must be the dominant, teaching of both the boys' and girls' lycées."", ""But, "" he said,  ""such a notion would have little chance of success."", But this last period of his life,  so fecund,  was,  alas,  soon to end. His, admirable scientific career was to be suddenly broken at the very moment, when he could hope that the years of work to come would be less hard, than those which had preceded., In 1906,  quite ill and tired,  he went with me and the children to spend, Easter in the Chevreuse Valley. Those were two sweet days under a mild, sun,  and Pierre Curie felt the weight of weariness lighten in a healing, repose near to those who were dear to him. He amused himself in the, meadows with his little girls,  and talked with me of their present and, their future., He returned to Paris for a reunion and dinner of the Physics Society., There he sat beside Henri Poincaré and had a long conversation with him, on methods of teaching. As we were returning on foot to our house,  he, continued to develop his ideas on the culture that he dreamed of,  happy, in the consciousness that I shared his views., The following day,  the 19th of April,  1906,  he attended a reunion of the, Association of Professors of the Faculties of the Sciences,  where he, talked with them very cordially about the aims which the Association, might adopt. As he went out from this reunion and was crossing the rue, Dauphine,  he was struck by a truck coming from the Pont Neuf,  and fell, under its wheels. A concussion of the brain brought instantaneous death., So perished the hope founded on the wonderful being who thus ceased to, he. In the study room to which he was never to return,  the water, buttercups he had brought from the country were still fresh., [9], During my recent visit to America,  where a gramme of radium, was generously offered me by American women,  the Buffalo Society of, Natural Sciences presented me,  as a souvenir,  with a publication, reviewing the development of the radium industry in the United States., This included photographic reproductions of letters from Pierre Curie in, which he replied in as complete a manner as possible to the questions, asked by American engineers. (1902 and 1903.), [10], The price of a milligramme of the element of radium was, then fixed at about 750 francs., [11], These physicians were aided by the manufacturer,  Armet de, Lisle,  who placed at their disposition the radium needed for their first, undertakings. He founded,  besides,  in 1906,  a laboratory for clinical, study,  provided with a supply of radium. And he subventioned the first, special publication devoted to radioactivity and its applications,  as a, journal under the name, Radium,  edited by J. Danne. This is an, example of generous support of science by industry,  in reality still very, rare but which one wishes might become general,  in the common interest of, these two branches of human activity., [12], The hypothesis according to which radioactivity is bound, up with the atomic transformation of elements was first envisaged by, Pierre Curie and by me,  along with other possible hypotheses,  before it, was utilized by E. Rutherford. (See, Revue Scientifique,  1900,  Mme., Curie,  etc.), [13], By using the unusual energy of Alpha-rays E. Rutherford, has obtained recently the rupture of certain light atoms,  like those of, nitrogen., CHAPTER VII, THE NATION'S SORROW. THE LABORATORIES:, ""SACRED PLACES"", I shall not attempt to describe the grief of the family left by Pierre, Curie. By what I have earlier said in this narrative one can understand, what he meant to his father,  his brother,  and his wife. He was,  too,  a, devoted father,  tender in his love for his children,  and happy to occupy, himself with them. But our daughters were still too young at this time, to realize the calamity that had befallen us. Their grandfather and I, united in our common suffering,  did what we could to see that their, childhood should not be too much darkened by the disaster., The news of the catastrophe caused veritable consternation in the, scientific world of France,  as well as in that of other countries. The, heads of the university and the professors expressed their emotion in, letters full of sympathy,  and a great number of foreign scientists also, sent letters and telegrams. No less deep was the impression produced on, the public with whom Pierre Curie,  despite his reserve,  enjoyed great, renown. This feeling was expressed in numerous private letters coming, not only from those whom we knew,  but also from persons entirely unknown, to us. At the same time the press printed articles of regret,  bearing, the stamp of deep sincerity. The French government sent its condolences, and a few rulers of foreign countries sent their personal expressions of, sympathy. One of the purest glories of France had been extinguished,  and, each understood that this was a nation's sorrow., [14], Faithful to the memory of him who had left us,  we wished a simple, interment in the family vault in the little cemetery at Sceaux. There, was neither official ceremony nor address,  and only his friends, accompanied him to his last home. As he thought of him who was no more, his brother Jacques said to me: ""He had all the gifts; there were not, two like him."", In order to assure the continuance of his work,  the Faculty of Sciences, of Paris paid me the very great honor of asking me to take the place, that he had occupied. I accepted this heavy heritage,  in the hope that I, might build up some day,  in his memory,  a laboratory worthy of him, which he had never had,  but where others would be able to work to, develop his idea. This hope is now partly realized,  thanks to the common, initiative of the University and the Pasteur Institute,  which have aimed, at the creation of a Radium Institute,  composed of two laboratories,  the, Curie and the Pasteur,  destined for the physicochemical and the, biological study of radium rays. In touching homage to him who had, disappeared the new street leading to the Institute was named rue Pierre, Curie., This Institute is,  however,  insufficient in view of the considerable, development of radioactivity and of its therapeutic applications. The, best authorized persons now recognize that France must possess a Radium, Institute comparable to those of England and America for the, Curietherapie, which has become an efficacious means in the battle, against cancer. It is to be hoped that with generous and far-seeing aid, we shall have,  in a few years,  a Radium Institute complete and enlarged, worthy of our country., To honor the memory of Pierre Curie,  the French Society of Physics, decided to issue a complete publication of his works. This publication, arranged by P. Langevin and C. Cheneveau,  comprises but a single volume, of about 600 pages,  which appeared in 1908,  and for which I wrote a, preface. This unique volume,  which includes a work as important as it is, varied,  is a faithful reflection of the mentality of the author. One, finds in it a great richness of ideas and of experimental facts leading, to clear and well-established results,  but the exposition is limited to, the strictly necessary,  and is irreproachable,  one might even say, classical,  in form. It is to be regretted that Pierre Curie did not use, his gifts as scientist and author in writing extended memoirs or books., It was not the desire that was lacking; he had several cherished, projects of this nature. But he could never put them into execution, because of the difficulties with which he had to struggle during all his, working life., And now,  let us glance at this narrative as a whole,  in which I have, attempted to evoke the image of a man who,  inflexibly devoted to the, service of his ideal,  honored humanity by an existence lived in silence, in the simple grandeur of his genius and his character. He had the faith, of those who open new ways. He knew that he had a high mission to fulfil, and the mystic dream of his youth pushed him invincibly beyond the usual, path of life into a way which he called anti-natural because it, signified the renunciation of the pleasures of life. Nevertheless,  he, resolutely subordinated his thoughts and desires to this dream,  adapting, himself to it and identifying himself with it more and more completely., Believing only in the pacific might of science and of reason,  he lived, for the search of truth. Without prejudice or, parti pris,  he carried, the same loyalty into his study of things that he used in his, understanding of other men and of himself. Detached from every common, passion,  seeking neither supremacy nor honors,  he had no enemies,  even, though the effort he had achieved in the control of himself had made of, him one of those elect whom we find in advance of their time in all the, epochs of civilization. Like them he was able to exercise a profound, influence merely by the radiation of his inner strength., It is useful to learn how much sacrifice such a life represents. The, life of a great scientist in his laboratory is not,  as many may think,  a, peaceful idyll. More often it is a bitter battle with things,  with one's, surroundings,  and above all with oneself. A great discovery does not, leap completely achieved from the brain of the scientist,  as Minerva, sprang,  all panoplied,  from the head of Jupiter; it is the fruit of, accumulated preliminary work. Between the days of fecund productivity, are inserted days of uncertainty when nothing seems to succeed,  and when, even matter itself seems hostile; and it is then that one must hold out, against discouragement. Thus without ever forsaking his inexhaustible, patience,  Pierre Curie used sometimes to say to me: ""It is nevertheless, hard,  this life that we have chosen."", For the admirable gift of himself,  and for the magnificent service he, renders humanity,  what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have, these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an, assured existence,  sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curie,  and, of others,  shows that they have none of these things; and that more, often,  before they can secure possible working conditions,  they have to, exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society,  in, which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury,  does not understand, the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most, precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient, cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress, that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither, public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to, scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully, effective work., I invoke,  in closing,  the admirable pleading of Pasteur:, ""If the conquests useful for humanity touch your heart,  if you are, overwhelmed before the astonishing results of electric telegraphy,  of, the daguerrotype,  of anesthesia,  and of other wonderful discoveries,  if, you are jealous of the part your country may claim in the spreading of, these marvelous things,  take an interest,  I beg of you,  in those sacred, places to which we give the expressive name of laboratories. Demand that, they be multiplied and ornamented,  for these are the temples of the, future,  of wealth,  and of well-being. It is in them that humanity grows, fortifies itself,  and becomes better. There it may learn to read in the, works of nature the story of progress and of universal harmony,  even, while its own creations are too often those of barbarism,  fanaticism, and destruction."", May this truth be widely spread,  and deeply penetrate public opinion, that the future may be less hard for the pioneers who must open up new, domains for the general good of humanity., Extracts from Published Appreciations, I have chosen certain extracts from various published appreciations of, Pierre Curie in order to complete my account by a few moving testimonies, from eminent men of science., Henri Poincaré, :, ""Curie was one of those on whom Science and France believed they had the, right to count. His age permitted far-reaching hopes; what he had, already given seemed a promise,  and we knew that,  living,  he would not, have failed. On the night preceding his death (pardon this personal, memory) I sat next to him and he talked with me of his plans and his, ideas. I admired the fecundity and the depth of his thought,  the new, aspect which physical phenomena took on when looked at through that, original and lucid mind. I felt that I better understood the grandeur of, human intelligence—and the following day,  in an instant,  all was, annihilated. A stupid accident brutally reminded us how little place, thought holds in the face of the thousand blind forces that hurl, themselves across the world without knowing whither they go,  crushing, all in their passage., ""His friends,  his colleagues understood at once the import of the loss, they suffered,  but the grief extended far beyond them. In foreign, countries the most illustrious scientists joined in trying to show the, esteem in which they held our compatriot,  while in our own land there, was no Frenchman,  however ignorant,  who did not feel more or less, vaguely what a force his nation and humanity had lost., ""Curie brought to his study of physical phenomena I do not know what, very fine sense which made him divine unsuspected analogies,  and made it, possible for him to orient himself in a labyrinth of complex appearances, where others would have gone astray.... True physicists,  like Curie, neither look within themselves,  nor on the surface of things,  but they, know how to look through things., ""All those who knew him knew their pleasure and surety in his, acquaintance,  and the delicate charm that was exhaled,  one might say,  by, his gentle modesty,  by his naïve directness,  by the fineness of his, spirit. Always ready to efface himself before his family,  before his, friends,  and even before his rivals,  he was what one calls a 'poor, candidate'; but in our democracy candidates are the least thing we lack., ""Who would have thought that so much gentleness concealed an, intransigeant soul? He did not compromise with those general principles, on which he was nourished,  nor with the particular moral ideal he had, been taught to love,  that ideal of absolute sincerity,  too high, perhaps,  for the world in which we live. He did not know the thousand, little accommodations with which our weakness contents itself. Moreover, he never separated the worship of this ideal from what he rendered to, science,  and he gave us a shining example of the high conception of duty, that may spring from a simple and pure love of truth. It matters little, in what God he believed; it is not the God,  but faith,  that performs, miracles."", Institut de France, : Written about P. Curie by M. D. Gernez., ""All for work,  all for science: this sums up the life of Pierre Curie,  a, life so rich in brilliant discoveries and in the outlook of genius that, it won him practically universal admiration. In the full maturity of his, investigations whose progress he so eagerly pursued his work was ended, to the consternation of us all,  by a terrible catastrophe on the 19th of, April,  1906...., ""All these honors did not dazzle him; he was and he will remain a, remarkable figure among those who make the scientific history of our, epoch. His contemporaries found in him a precious example of a devotion, to science at once unyielding and disinterested. There have been few, lives more pure and more justly famous."", Jean Perrin, :, ""Pierre Curie,  whom all called a master,  and whom we had the joy to, call,  too,  our friend,  died suddenly in the fullness of his powers...., We will try to show through him,  as an example,  what part a powerful, genius can return to sincerity,  to liberty,  to the strong and calm, audacity of thought which nothing can enchain and nothing can astonish., We acknowledge also all the greatness of the soul where these fine, qualities of intelligence and character were united in a most noble, unselfishness and most exquisite goodness., ""Those who have known Pierre Curie,  know that,  near him one felt awaken, the need to do and to understand. We will try to honor his memory by, spreading abroad this impression,  and we will ask his pale and beautiful, face for the secret of that radiation which made all those who, approached him better men."", C. Cheneveau, :, ""... In order to realize our irreparable loss we must remember Curie's, attachment to his students.... Some of us offered him,  with reason,  a, veritable worship.... For myself,  he was,  next to my own family,  one of, those I loved most. How well he knew how to surround his simple, collaborator with a great and tender affection. His immense kindness, extended even to his most humble helpers,  who adored him. I have never, seen more sincere and more heart-breaking tears than those shed by the, laboratory boys on the news of his sudden death."", Paul Langevin, :, ""... The hours when one could meet him and in which one loved to talk, about his science and in which one thought with him,  return each day to, recall his memory,  to bring back his kindly and thoughtful face,  his, luminous eyes and his beautiful,  expressive head modeled by twenty-five, years passed in the laboratory,  and by a life of unremittent work and, complete simplicity., ""... It is in his laboratory that my memories,  still so recent,  most, readily bring him back to me,  as he would appear to those near to whom, he had grown older,  scarcely changed by the eighteen years that have, passed since. Timid and often awkward,  I began under him my laboratory, education...., ""Surrounded by apparatus for the greater part conceived or modified by, himself,  he manipulated it with extreme dexterity,  with the familiar, gestures of the long white hands of the physicist...., ""He was twenty-nine years old when I entered as a student. The mastery, which ten years,  passed entirely in the laboratory,  had given him, imposed itself even on us,  despite our ignorance,  by the surety of his, movements and explanations,  and the ease,  shaded by timidity,  of his, manner. We returned always with joy to the laboratory,  where it was good, to work near him because we felt him working near to us in that large, light room filled with apparatus whose forms were still a little, mysterious to us. We did not fear to enter it often to consult him,  and, he sometimes admitted us,  too,  to perform some particularly delicate, manipulation. Probably my finest memories of my school years are those, of moments passed there standing before the blackboard where he took, pleasure in talking with us,  in awakening in us fruitful ideas,  and in, discussions of research which formed our taste for the things of, science. His live and contagious curiosity,  the fullness and surety of, his information made him an admirable awakener of spirits."", I have wished above all,  in gathering together here these few memories, in a bouquet reverently placed upon his tomb,  to help,  if I can,  to fix, the image of a man truly great in character and in thought,  of a, wonderful representative of the genius of our race. Entirely, unfranchised from ancient servitudes,  and passionately loving reason and, clarity,  he was an example—as is a prophet inspired by truths of the, future—of what may be realized in moral beauty and goodness by a free, and upright spirit,  of constant courage,  and of a mental honesty which, made him repulse what he did not understand,  and place his life in, accord with this dream., [14], From the great number of letters and telegrams of, condolence,  I quote,  as examples,  these lines written by three great, scientists,  today no longer living., From M. Berthelot:, ""MADAME:, ""I do not wish to wait longer without sending you the sympathetic, expression of my profound grief and of that of French and foreign, scientists on the occasion of the common loss with you that we have all, experienced. We were struck as by lightning by the tragic news! So many, services already rendered science and humanity,  so many services that we, awaited from that genial inventor: all this vanished in an instant,  or, become already but a memory!"", From G. Lippmann:, ""MADAME:, It is while traveling,  and very late,  that I receive the terrible news., I feel as if I had lost a brother; I did not know by what close ties I, was attached to your husband. I know today. I suffer also for you, Madame. Believe in my sincere and respectful devotion."", From Lord Kelvin:, ""Grievously distressed by terrible news of Curie's death. When will be, funeral. We arrive Hotel Mirabeau tomorrow morning. Kelvin,  Villa St., Martin,  Cannes."", AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES—MARIE CURIE, CHAPTER I, I have been asked by my American friends to write the story of my life., At first,  the idea seemed alien to me,  but I yielded to persuasion., However,  I could not conceive my biography as a complete expression of, personal feelings or a detailed description of all incidents I would, remember. Many of our feelings change with the years,  and,  when faded, away,  may seem altogether strange; incidents lose their momentary, interest and may be remembered as if they have occurred to some other, person. But there may be in a life some general direction,  some, continuous thread,  due to a few dominant ideas and a few strong, feelings,  that explain the life and are characteristic of a human, personality. Of my life,  which has not been easy on the whole,  I have, described the general course and the essential features,  and I trust, that my story gives an understanding of the state of mind in which I, have lived and worked., My family is of Polish origin,  and my name is Marie Sklodowska. My, father and my mother both came from among the small Polish landed, proprietors. In my country this class is composed of a large number of, families,  owners of small and medium-sized estates,  frequently, interrelated. It has been,  until recently,  chiefly from this group that, Poland has drawn her intellectual recruits., While my paternal grandfather had divided his time between agriculture, and directing a provincial college,  my father,  more strongly drawn to, study,  followed the course of the University of Petrograd,  and later, definitely established himself at Warsaw as Professor of Physics and, Mathematics in one of the lyceums of that city. He married a young woman, whose mode of life was congenial to his; for,  although very young,  she, had,  what was,  for that time,  a very serious education,  and was the, director of one of the best Warsaw schools for young girls., My father and mother worshiped their profession in the highest degree, and have left,  all over their country,  a lasting remembrance with their, pupils. I cannot,  even to-day,  go into Polish society without meeting, persons who have tender memories of my parents., Although my parents adopted a university career,  they continued to keep, in close touch with their numerous family in the country. It was with, their relatives that I frequently spent my vacation,  living in all, freedom and finding opportunities to know the field life by which I was, deeply attracted. To these conditions,  so different from the usual, villegiature,  I believe,  I owe my love for the country and nature., Born at Warsaw,  on the 7th of November,  1867,  I was the last of five, children,  but my oldest sister died at the early age of fourteen,  and we, were left,  three sisters and a brother. Cruelly struck by the loss of, her daughter and worn away by a grave illness,  my mother died at, forty-two,  leaving her husband in the deepest sorrow with his children., I was then only nine years old,  and my eldest brother was hardly, thirteen., This catastrophe was the first great sorrow of my life and threw me into, a profound depression. My mother had an exceptional personality. With, all her intellectuality she had a big heart and a very high sense of, duty. And,  though possessing infinite indulgence and good nature,  she, still held in the family a remarkable moral authority. She had an ardent, piety (my parents were both Catholics),  but she was never intolerant;, differences in religious belief did not trouble her; she was equally, kind to any one not sharing her opinions. Her influence over me was, extraordinary,  for in me the natural love of the little girl for her, mother was united with a passionate admiration., Very much affected by the death of my mother,  my father devoted himself, entirely to his work and to the care of our education. His professional, obligations were heavy and left him little leisure time. For many years, we all felt weighing on us the loss of the one who had been the soul of, the house., We all started our studies very young. I was only six years old,  and, because I was the youngest and smallest in the class,  was frequently, brought forward to recite when there were visitors. This was a great, trial to me,  because of my timidity; I wanted always to run away and, hide. My father,  an excellent educator,  was interested in our work and, knew how to direct it,  but the conditions of our education were, difficult. We began our studies in private schools and finished them in, those of the government., Warsaw was then under Russian domination,  and one of the worst aspects, of this control was the oppression exerted on the school and the child., The private schools directed by Poles were closely watched by the police, and overburdened with the necessity of teaching the Russian language, even to children so young that they could scarcely speak their native, Polish. Nevertheless,  since the teachers were nearly all of Polish, nationality,  they endeavored in every possible way to mitigate the, difficulties resulting from the national persecution. These schools, however,  could not legally give diplomas,  which were obtainable only in, those of the government., The latter,  entirely Russian,  were directly opposed to the Polish, national spirit. All instruction was given in Russian,  by Russian, professors,  who,  being hostile to the Polish nation,  treated their, pupils as enemies. Men of moral and intellectual distinction could, scarcely agree to teach in schools where an alien attitude was forced, upon them. So what the pupils were taught was of questionable value,  and, the moral atmosphere was altogether unbearable. Constantly held in, suspicion and spied upon,  the children knew that a single conversation, in Polish,  or an imprudent word,  might seriously harm,  not only, themselves,  but also their families. Amidst these hostilities,  they lost, all the joy of life,  and precocious feelings of distrust and indignation, weighed upon their childhood. On the other side,  this abnormal situation, resulted in exciting the patriotic feeling of Polish youths to the, highest degree., Yet of this period of my early youth,  darkened though it was by, mourning and the sorrow of oppression,  I still keep more than one, pleasant remembrance. In our quiet but occupied life,  reunions of, relatives and friends of our family brought some joy. My father was very, interested in literature and well acquainted with Polish and foreign, poetry; he even composed poetry himself and was able to translate it, from foreign languages into Polish in a very successful way. His little, poems on family events were our delight. On Saturday evenings he used to, recite or read to us the masterpieces of Polish prose and poetry. These, evenings were for us a great pleasure and a source of renewed patriotic, feelings., Since my childhood I have had a strong taste for poetry,  and I willingly, learned by heart long passages from our great poets,  the favorite ones, being Mickiewecz,  Krasinski and Slowacki. This taste was even more, developed when I became acquainted with foreign literatures; my early, studies included the knowledge of French,  German,  and Russian,  and I, soon became familiar with the fine works written in these languages., Later I felt the need of knowing English and succeeded in acquiring the, knowledge of that language and its literature., My musical studies have been very scarce. My mother was a musician and, had a beautiful voice. She wanted us to have musical training. After her, death,  having no more encouragement from her,  I soon abandoned this, effort,  which I often regretted afterwards., I learned easily mathematics and physics,  as far as these sciences were, taken in consideration in the school. I found in this ready help from my, father,  who loved science and had to teach it himself. He enjoyed any, explanation he could give us about Nature and her ways. Unhappily,  he, had no laboratory and could not perform experiments., The periods of vacations were particularly comforting,  when,  escaping, the strict watch of the police in the city,  we took refuge with, relatives or friends in the country. There we found the free life of the, old-fashioned family estate; races in the woods and joyous participation, in work in the far-stretching,  level grain-fields. At other times we, passed the border of our Russian-ruled division (Congress Poland) and, went southwards into the mountain country of Galicia,  where the Austrian, political control was less oppressive than that which we suffered. There, we could speak Polish in all freedom and sing patriotic songs without, going to prison., My first impression of the mountains was very vivid,  because I had been, brought up in the plains. So I enjoyed immensely our life in the, Carpathian villages,  the view of the pikes,  the excursions to the, valleys and to the high mountain lakes with picturesque names such as:, ""The Eye of the Sea."" However,  I never lost my attachment to the open, horizon and the gentle views of a plain hill country., Later I had the opportunity to spend a vacation with my father far more, south in Podolia,  and to have the first view of the sea at Odessa,  and, afterwards at the Baltic shore. This was a thrilling experience. But it, was in France that I become acquainted with the big waves of the ocean, and the ever-changing tide. All my life through,  the new sights of, Nature made me rejoice like a child., Thus passed the period of our school life. We all had much facility for, intellectual work. My brother,  Doctor Sklodowski,  having finished his, medical studies,  became later the chief physician in one of the, principal Warsaw hospitals. My sisters and I intended to take up, teaching as our parents had done. However,  my elder sister,  when grown, up,  changed her mind and decided to study medicine. She took the degree, of doctor at the Paris University,  married Doctor Dluski,  a Polish, physician,  and together they established an important sanatorium in a, wonderfully beautiful Carpathian mountain place of Austrian Poland. My, second sister,  married in Warsaw,  Mrs. Szalay,  was for many years a, teacher in the schools,  where she rendered great service. Later she was, appointed in one of the lyceums of free Poland., I was but fifteen when I finished my high-school studies,  always having, held first rank in my class. The fatigue of growth and study compelled, me to take almost a year's rest in the country. I then returned to my, father in Warsaw,  hoping to teach in the free schools. But family, circumstances obliged me to change my decision. My father,  now aged and, tired,  needed rest; his fortune was very modest. So I resolved to accept, a position as governess for several children. Thus,  when scarcely, seventeen,  I left my father's house to begin an independent life., That going away remains one of the most vivid memories of my youth. My, heart was heavy as I climbed into the railway car. It was to carry me, for several hours,  away from those I loved. And after the railway, journey I must drive for five hours longer. What experience was awaiting, me? So I questioned as I sat close to the car window looking out across, the wide plains., The father of the family to which I went was an agriculturist. His, oldest daughter was about my age,  and although working with me,  was my, companion rather than my pupil. There were two younger children,  a boy, and a girl. My relations with my pupils were friendly; after our lessons, we went together for daily walks. Loving the country,  I did not feel, lonesome,  and although this particular country was not especially, picturesque,  I was satisfied with it in all seasons. I took the greatest, interest in the agricultural development of the estate where the methods, were considered as models for the region. I knew the progressive details, of the work,  the distribution of crops in the fields; I eagerly followed, the growth of the plants,  and in the stables of the farm I knew the, horses., In winter the vast plains,  covered with snow,  were not lacking in charm, and we went for long sleigh rides. Sometimes we could hardly see the, road. ""Look out for the ditch!"" I would call to the driver. ""You are, going straight into it, "" and ""Never fear!"" he would answer,  as over we, went! But these tumbles only added to the gayety of our excursions., I remember the marvelous snow house we made one winter when the snow was, very high in the fields; we could sit in it and look out across the, rose-tinted snow plains. We also used to skate on the ice of the river, and to watch the weather anxiously,  to make sure that the ice was not, going to give way,  depriving us of our pleasure., Since my duties with my pupils did not take up all my time,  I organized, a small class for the children of the village who could not be educated, under the Russian government. In this the oldest daughter of the house, aided me. We taught the little children and the girls who wished to come, how to read and write,  and we put in circulation Polish books which were, appreciated,  too,  by the parents. Even this innocent work presented, danger,  as all initiative of this kind was forbidden by the government, and might bring imprisonment or deportation to Siberia., My evenings I generally devoted to study. I had heard that a few women, had succeeded in following certain courses in Petrograd or in foreign, countries,  and I was determined to prepare myself by preliminary work to, follow their example., I had not yet decided what path I would choose. I was as much interested, in literature and sociology as in science. However,  during these years, of isolated work,  trying little by little to find my real preferences,  I, finally turned towards mathematics and physics,  and resolutely undertook, a serious preparation for future work. This work I proposed doing in, Paris,  and I hoped to save enough money to be able to live and work in, that city for some time., My solitary study was beset with difficulties. The scientific education, I had received at the lyceum was very incomplete; it was well under the, bachelorship program of a French lyceum; I tried to add to it in my own, way,  with the help of books picked up at random. This method could not, be greatly productive,  yet it was not without results. I acquired the, habit of independent work,  and learned a few things which were to be of, use later on., I had to modify my plans for the future when my eldest sister decided to, go to Paris to study medicine. We had promised each other mutual aid, but our means did not permit of our leaving together. So I kept my, position for three and a half years,  and,  having finished my work with, my pupils,  I returned to Warsaw,  where a position,  similar to the one I, had left,  was awaiting me., I kept this new place for only a year and then went back to my father, who had retired some time before and was living alone. Together we, passed an excellent year,  he occupying himself with some literary work, while I increased our funds by giving private lessons. Meantime I, continued my efforts to educate myself. This was no easy task under the, Russian government of Warsaw; yet I found more opportunities than in the, country. To my great joy,  I was able,  for the first time in my life,  to, find access to a laboratory: a small municipal physical laboratory, directed by one of my cousins. I found little time to work there,  except, in the evenings and on Sundays,  and was generally left to myself. I, tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and, chemistry,  and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times I would, be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success,  at others I would be in, the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my, inexperience. But on the whole,  though I was taught that the way of, progress is neither swift nor easy,  this first trial confirmed in me the, taste for experimental research in the fields of physics and chemistry., Other means of instruction came to me through my being one of an, enthusiastic group of young men and women of Warsaw,  who united in a, common desire to study,  and whose activities were at the same time, social and patriotic. It was one of those groups of Polish youths who, believed that the hope of their country lay in a great effort to develop, the intellectual and moral strength of the nation,  and that such an, effort would lead to a better national situation. The nearest purpose, was to work at one's own instruction and to provide means of instruction, for workmen and peasants. In accordance with this program we agreed, among ourselves to give evening courses,  each one teaching what he knew, best. There is no need to say that this was a secret organization,  which, made everything extremely difficult. There were in our group very, devoted young people who,  as I still believe today,  could do truly, useful work., I have a bright remembrance of the sympathetic intellectual and social, companionship which I enjoyed at that time. Truly the means of action, were poor and the results obtained could not be considerable; yet I, still believe that the ideas which inspired us then are the only way to, real social progress. You cannot hope to build a better world without, improving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own, improvement,  and at the same time share a general responsibility for all, humanity,  our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can, be most useful., All the experiences of this period intensified my longing for further, study. And,  in his affection for me,  my father,  in spite of limited, resources,  helped me to hasten the execution of my early project. My, sister had just married at Paris,  and it was decided that I should go, there to live with her. My father and I hoped that,  once my studies were, finished,  we would again live happily together. Fate was to decide, otherwise,  since my marriage was to hold me in France. My father,  who in, his own youth had wished to do scientific work,  was consoled in our, separation by the progressive success of my work. I keep a tender memory, of his kindness and disinterestedness. He lived with the family of my, married brother,  and,  like an excellent grandfather,  brought up the, children. We had the sorrow of losing him in 1902,  when he had just, passed seventy., So it was in November,  1891,  at the age of twenty-four,  that I was able, to realize the dream that had been always present in my mind for several, years., When I arrived in Paris I was affectionately welcomed by my sister and, brother-in-law,  but I stayed with them only for a few months,  for they, lived in one of the outside quarters of Paris where my brother-in-law, was beginning a medical practice,  and I needed to get nearer to the, schools. I was finally installed,  like many other students of my, country,  in a modest little room for which I gathered some furniture. I, kept to this way of living during the four years of my student life., It would be impossible to tell of all the good these years brought to, me. Undistracted by any outside occupation,  I was entirely absorbed in, the joy of learning and understanding. Yet,  all the while,  my living, conditions were far from easy,  my own funds being small and my family, not having the means to aid me as they would have liked to do. However, my situation was not exceptional; it was the familiar experience of many, of the Polish students whom I knew. The room I lived in was in a garret, very cold in winter,  for it was insufficiently heated by a small stove, which often lacked coal. During a particularly rigorous winter,  it was, not unusual for the water to freeze in the basin in the night; to be, able to sleep I was obliged to pile all my clothes on the bedcovers. In, the same room I prepared my meals with the aid of an alcohol lamp and a, few kitchen utensils. These meals were often reduced to bread with a cup, of chocolate,  eggs or fruit. I had no help in housekeeping and I myself, carried the little coal I used up the six flights., This life,  painful from certain points of view,  had,  for all that,  a, real charm for me. It gave me a very precious sense of liberty and, independence. Unknown in Paris,  I was lost in the great city,  but the, feeling of living there alone,  taking care of myself without any aid, did not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome,  my usual state, of mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction., All my mind was centered on my studies,  which,  especially at the, beginning,  were difficult. In fact,  I was insufficiently prepared to, follow the physical science course at the Sorbonne,  for,  despite all my, efforts,  I had not succeeded in acquiring in Poland a preparation as, complete as that of the French students following the same course. So I, was obliged to supply this deficiency,  especially in mathematics. I, divided my time between courses,  experimental work,  and study in the, library. In the evening I worked in my room,  sometimes very late into, the night. All that I saw and learned that was new delighted me. It was, like a new world opened to me,  the world of science,  which I was at last, permitted to know in all liberty., I have pleasant memories of my relations with my student companions., Reserved and shy at the beginning,  it was not long before I noticed that, the students,  nearly all of whom worked seriously,  were disposed to be, friendly. Our conversations about our studies deepened our interest in, the problems we discussed., Among the Polish students I did not have any companions in my studies., Nevertheless,  my relations with their small colony had a certain, intimacy. From time to time we would gather in one another's bare rooms, where we could talk over national questions and feel less isolated. We, would also go for walks together,  or attend public reunions,  for we were, all interested in politics. By the end of the first year,  however,  I was, forced to give up these relationships,  for I found that all my energy, had to be concentrated on my studies,  in order to achieve them as soon, as possible. I was even obliged to devote most of my vacation time to, mathematics., My persistent efforts were not in vain. I was able to make up for the, deficiency of my training and to pass examinations at the same time with, the other students. I even had the satisfaction of graduating in first, rank as "", licenciée es sciences physiques, "" in 1893,  and in second, rank as "", licenciée es sciences mathématiques, "" in 1894., My brother-in-law,  recalling later these years of work under the, conditions I have just described,  jokingly referred to them as ""the, heroic period of my sister-in-law's life."" For myself,  I shall always, consider one of the best memories of my life that period of solitary, years exclusively devoted to the studies,  finally within my reach,  for, which I had waited so long., It was in 1894 that I first met Pierre Curie. One of my compatriots,  a, professor at the University of Fribourg,  having called upon me,  invited, me to his home,  with a young physicist of Paris,  whom he knew and, esteemed highly. Upon entering the room I perceived,  standing framed by, the French window opening on the balcony,  a tall young man with auburn, hair and large,  limpid eyes. I noticed the grave and gentle expression, of his face,  as well as a certain abandon in his attitude,  suggesting, the dreamer absorbed in his reflections. He showed me a simple, cordiality and seemed to me very sympathetic. After that first interview, he expressed the desire to see me again and to continue our conversation, of that evening on scientific and social subjects in which he and I were, both interested,  and on which we seemed to have similar opinions., Some time later,  he came to me in my student room and we became good, friends. He described to me his days,  filled with work,  and his dream of, an existence entirely devoted to science. He was not long in asking me, to share that existence,  but I could not decide at once; I hesitated, before a decision that meant abandoning my country and my family., I went back to Poland for my vacation,  without knowing whether or not I, was to return to Paris. But circumstances permitted me again to take up, my work there in the autumn of that year. I entered one of the physics, laboratories at the Sorbonne,  to begin experimental research in, preparation for my doctor's thesis., Again I saw Pierre Curie. Our work drew us closer and closer,  until we, were both convinced that neither of us could find a better life, companion. So our marriage was decided upon and took place a little, later,  in July,  1895., Pierre Curie had just received his doctor's degree and had been made, professor in the School of Physics and Chemistry of the City of Paris., He was thirty-six years old,  and already a physicist known and, appreciated in France and abroad. Solely preoccupied with scientific, investigation,  he had paid little attention to his career,  and his, material resources were very modest. He lived at Sceaux,  in the suburbs, of Paris,  with his old parents,  whom he loved tenderly,  and whom he, described as ""exquisite"" the first time he spoke to me about them. In, fact,  they were so: the father was an elderly physician of high, intellect and strong character,  and the mother the most excellent of, women,  entirely devoted to her husband and her sons. Pierre's elder, brother,  who was then professor at the University of Montpellier,  was, always his best friend. So I had the privilege of entering into a family, worthy of affection and esteem,  and where I found the warmest welcome., We were married in the simplest way. I wore no unusual dress on my, marriage day,  and only a few friends were present at the ceremony,  but, I had the joy of having my father and my second sister come from Poland., We did not care for more than a quiet place in which to live and to, work,  and were happy to find a little apartment of three rooms with a, beautiful view of a garden. A few pieces of furniture came to us from, our parents. With a money gift from a relative we acquired two bicycles, to take us out into the country., CHAPTER II, With my marriage there began for me a new existence entirely different, from the solitary life that I had known during the preceding years. My, husband and I were so closely united by our affection and our common, work that we passed nearly all of our time together. I have only a few, letters from him,  for we were so little apart. My husband spent all the, time he could spare from his teaching at his research work in the, laboratory of the school in which he was professor and I obtained, authorization to work with him., Our living apartment was near the school,  so we lost little time in, going and coming. As our material resources were limited,  I was obliged, to attend to most of the housekeeping myself,  particularly the, preparation of meals. It was not easy to reconcile these household, duties with my scientific work,  yet,  with good will,  I managed it. The, great thing was that we were alone together in the little home which, gave us a peace and intimacy that were very enjoyable for us., At the same time that I was working in the laboratory,  I still had to, take a few study courses,  for I had decided to take part in the, examination for a certificate that would allow me to teach young girls., If I succeeded in this,  I would be entitled to be named professor. In, August,  1896,  after having devoted several months to preparation,  I came, out first in the examination., Our principal distraction from the close work of the laboratory, consisted in walks or bicycle rides in the country. My husband greatly, enjoyed the out-of-doors and took great interest in the plants and, animals of woods and meadows. Hardly a corner in the vicinity of Paris, was unknown to him. I also loved the country and these excursions were a, great joy for me as well as to him,  relieving our mind from the tension, of the scientific work. We used to bring home bunches of flowers., Sometimes we forgot all about the time and got back late at night. We, visited regularly my husband's parents where our room was always ready., In the vacation we went on longer outings by means of our bicycles. In, this way we covered much ground in Auvergne and in the Cevennes and, visited several regions at the seashore. We took a great delight in, these long all-day excursions,  arriving at night always in a new place., If we stayed in one place too long,  my husband began to wish to get back, to the laboratory. It is also in vacation time that we visited once my, family in the Carpathian mountains. My husband learned some Polish in, view of this journey to Poland., But first of all in our life was our scientific work. My husband gave, much care to the preparation of his courses,  and I gave him some, assistance in this,  which,  at the time,  helped me in my education., However,  most of our time was devoted to our laboratory researches., My husband did not then have a private laboratory. He could,  to some, extent,  use the laboratory of the school for his own work,  but found, more freedom by installing himself in some unused corner of the Physics, School building. I thus learned from his example that one could work, happily even in very insufficient quarters. At this time my husband was, occupied with researches on crystals,  while I undertook an investigation, of the magnetic properties of steel. This work was completed and, published in 1897., In that same year the birth of our first daughter brought a great change, in our life. A few weeks later my husband's mother died and his father, came to live with us. We took a small house with a garden at the border, of Paris and continued to occupy this house as long as my husband lived., It became a serious problem how to take care of our little Irene and of, our home without giving up my scientific work. Such a renunciation would, have been very painful to me,  and my husband would not even think of it;, he used to say that he had got a wife made expressly for him to share, all his preoccupations. Neither of us would contemplate abandoning what, was so precious to both., Of course we had to have a servant,  but I personally saw to all the, details of the child's care. While I was in the laboratory,  she was in, the care of her grandfather,  who loved her tenderly and whose own life, was made brighter by her. So the close union of our family enabled me to, meet my obligations. Things were particularly difficult only in case of, more exceptional events,  such as a child's illness,  when sleepless, nights interrupted the normal course of life., It can be easily understood that there was no place in our life for, worldly relations. We saw but a few friends,  scientific workers,  like, ourselves,  with whom we talked in our home or in our garden,  while I did, some sewing for my little girl. We also maintained affectionate, relations with my husband's brother and his family. But I was separated, from all my relatives,  as my sister had left Paris with her husband to, live in Poland., It was under this mode of quiet living,  organized according to our, desires,  that we achieved the great work of our lives,  work begun about, the end of 1897 and lasting for many years., I had decided on a theme for my doctorate. My attention had been drawn, to the interesting experiments of Henri Becquerel on the salts of the, rare metal uranium. Becquerel had shown that by placing some uranium, salt on a photographic plate,  covered with black paper,  the plate would, be affected as if light had fallen on it. The effect is produced by, special rays which are emitted by the uranium salt and are different, from ordinary luminous rays as they can pass through black paper., Becquerel also showed that these rays can discharge an electroscope. He, at first thought that the uranium rays were produced as a result of, exposing the uranium salt to light,  but experiment showed that salts, kept for several months in the dark continued the peculiar rays., My husband and I were much excited by this new phenomenon,  and I, resolved to undertake the special study of it. It seemed to me that the, first thing to do was to measure the phenomenon with precision. In this, I decided to use that property of the rays which enabled them to, discharge an electroscope. However,  instead of the usual electroscope,  I, used a more perfect apparatus. One of the models of the apparatus used, by me for these first measurements is now in the College of Physicians, and Surgeons in Philadelphia., I was not long in obtaining interesting results. My determinations, showed that the emission of the rays is an atomic property of the, uranium,  whatever the physical or chemical conditions of the salt were., Any substance containing uranium is as much more active in emitting, rays,  as it contains more of this element., I then thought to find out if there were other substances possessing, this remarkable property of uranium,  and soon found that substances, containing thorium behaved in a similar way,  and that this behavior, depended similarly on an atomic property of thorium. I was now about to, undertake a detailed study of the uranium and thorium rays when I, discovered a new interesting fact., I had occasion to examine a certain number of minerals. A few of them, showed activity; they were those containing either uranium or thorium., The activity of these minerals would have had nothing astonishing about, it,  if it had been in proportion to the quantities of uranium or thorium, contained in them. But it was not so. Some of these minerals revealed an, activity three or four times greater than that of uranium. I verified, this surprising fact carefully,  and could not doubt its truth., Speculating about the reason for this,  there seemed to be but one, explanation. There must be,  I thought,  some unknown substance,  very, active,  in these minerals. My husband agreed with me and I urged that we, search at once for this hypothetical substance,  thinking that,  with, joined efforts,  a result would be quickly obtained. Neither of us could, foresee that in beginning this work we were to enter the path of a new, science which we should follow for all our future., Of course,  I did not expect,  even at the beginning,  to find a new, element in any large quantity,  as the minerals had already been analyzed, with some precision. At least,  I thought there might be as much as one, per cent of the unknown substance in the minerals. But the more we, worked,  the clearer we realized that the new radioactive element could, exist only in quite minute proportion and that,  in consequence,  its, activity must be very great. Would we have insisted,  despite the, scarcity of our means of research,  if we had known the true proportion, of what we were searching for,  no one can tell; all that can be said now, is that the constant progress of our work held us absorbed in a, passionate research,  while the difficulties were ever increasing. As a, matter of fact,  it was only after several years of most arduous labor, that we finally succeeded in completely separating the new substance, now known to everybody as radium. Here is,  briefly,  the story of the, search and discovery., As we did not know,  at the beginning,  any of the chemical properties of, the unknown substance,  but only that it emits rays,  it was by these rays, that we had to search. We first undertook the analysis of a pitchblende, from St. Joachimsthal. Analyzing this ore by the usual chemical methods, we added an examination of its different parts for radioactivity,  by the, use of our delicate electrical apparatus. This was the foundation of a, new method of chemical analysis which,  following our work,  has been, extended,  with the result that a large number of radioactive elements, have been discovered., In a few weeks we could be convinced that our prevision had been right, for the activity was concentrating in a regular way. And,  in a few, months,  we could separate from the pitchblende a substance accompanying, the bismuth,  much more active than uranium,  and having well defined, chemical properties. In July,  1898,  we announced the existence of this, new substance,  to which I gave the name of polonium,  in memory of my, native country., While engaged in this work on polonium,  we had also discovered that, accompanying the barium separated from the pitchblende,  there was, another new element. After several months more of close work we were, able to separate this second new substance,  which was afterwards shown, to be much more important than polonium. In December,  1898,  we could, announce the discovery of this new and now famous element,  to which we, gave the name of radium., However,  the greatest part of the material work had yet to be done. We, had,  to be sure,  discovered the existence of the remarkable new, elements,  but it was chiefly by their radiant properties that these new, substances were distinguished from the bismuth and barium with which, they were mixed in minute quantities. We had still to separate them as, pure elements. On this work we now started., We were very poorly equipped with facilities for this purpose. It was, necessary to subject large quantities of ore to careful chemical, treatment. We had no money,  no suitable laboratory,  no personal help for, our great and difficult undertaking. It was like creating something out, of nothing,  and if my earlier studying years had once been called by my, brother-in-law the heroic period of my life,  I can say without, exaggeration that the period on which my husband and I now entered was, truly the heroic one of our common life., We knew by our experiments that in the treatment of pitchblende at the, uranium plant of St. Joachimsthal,  radium must have been left in the, residues,  and,  with the permission of the Austrian government,  which, owned the plant,  we succeeded in securing a certain quantity of these, residues,  then quite valueless, —and used them for extraction of, radium. How glad I was when the sacks arrived,  with the brown dust mixed, with pine needles,  and when the activity proved even greater than that, of the primitive ore! It was a stroke of luck that the residues had not, been thrown far away or disposed of in some way,  but left in a heap in, the pine wood near the plant. Some time later,  the Austrian government, on the proposition of the Academy of Science of Vienna,  let us have, several tons of similar residues at a low price. With this material was, prepared all the radium I had in my laboratory up to the date when I, received the precious gift from the American women., The School of Physics could give us no suitable premises,  but for lack, of anything better,  the Director permitted us to use an abandoned shed, which had been in service as a dissecting room of the School of, Medicine. Its glass roof did not afford complete shelter against rain;, the heat was suffocating in summer,  and the bitter cold of winter was, only a little lessened by the iron stove,  except in its immediate, vicinity. There was no question of obtaining the needed proper apparatus, in common use by chemists. We simply had some old pine-wood tables with, furnaces and gas burners. We had to use the adjoining yard for those of, our chemical operations that involved producing irritating gases; even, then the gas often filled our shed. With this equipment we entered on, our exhausting work., Yet it was in this miserable old shed that we passed the best and, happiest years of our life,  devoting our entire days to our work. Often, I had to prepare our lunch in the shed,  so as not to interrupt some, particularly important operation. Sometimes I had to spend a whole day, mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I, would be broken with fatigue at the day's end. Other days,  on the, contrary,  the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional, crystallization,  in the effort to concentrate the radium. I was then, annoyed by the floating dust of iron and coal from which I could not, protect my precious products. But I shall never be able to express the, joy of the untroubled quietness of this atmosphere of research and the, excitement of actual progress with the confident hope of still better, results. The feeling of discouragement that sometimes came after some, unsuccessful toil did not last long and gave way to renewed activity. We, had happy moments devoted to a quiet discussion of our work,  walking, around our shed., One of our joys was to go into our workroom at night; we then perceived, on all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes of the bottles or capsules, containing our products. It was really a lovely sight and one always new, to us. The glowing tubes looked like faint,  fairy lights., Thus the months passed,  and our efforts,  hardly interrupted by short, vacations,  brought forth more and more complete evidence. Our faith grew, ever stronger,  and our work being more and more known,  we found means to, get new quantities of raw material and to carry on some of our crude, processes in a factory,  allowing me to give more time to the delicate, finishing treatment., At this stage I devoted myself especially to the purification of the, radium,  my husband being absorbed by the study of the physical, properties of the rays emitted by the new substances. It was only after, treating one ton of pitchblende residues that I could get definite, results. Indeed we know to-day that even in the best minerals there are, not more than a few decigrammes of radium in a ton of raw material., At last the time came when the isolated substances showed all the, characters of a pure chemical body. This body,  the radium,  gives a, characteristic spectrum,  and I was able to determine for it an atomic, weight much higher than that of the barium. This was achieved in 1902. I, then possessed one decigramme of very pure radium chloride. It had taken, me almost four years to produce the kind of evidence which chemical, science demands,  that radium is truly a new element. One year would, probably have been enough for the same purpose,  if reasonable means had, been at my disposal. The demonstration that cost so much effort was the, basis of the new science of radioactivity., In later years I was able to prepare several decigrammes of pure radium, salt,  to make a more accurate determination of the atomic weight and, even to isolate the pure radium metal. However,  1902 was the year in, which the existence and character of radium were definitely established., We had been able to live for several years entirely engrossed in the, work of research,  but gradually circumstances changed. In 1900 my, husband was offered a professorship in the University of Geneva,  but, almost simultaneously he obtained a position of assistant professor at, the Sorbonne,  and I was made professor at the Normal Superior School for, young girls at Sèvres. So we remained in Paris., I became much interested in my work in the Normal School,  and endeavored, to develop more fully the practical laboratory exercises of the pupils., These pupils were girls of about twenty years who had entered the school, after severe examination and had still to work very seriously to meet, the requirements that would enable them to be named professors in the, lycées. All these young women worked with great eagerness,  and it was a, pleasure for me to direct their studies in physics., But a growing notoriety,  because of the announcement of our discoveries, began to trouble our quiet work in the laboratory,  and,  little by, little,  life became more difficult. In 1903 I finished my doctor's, thesis and obtained the degree. At the end of the same year the Nobel, prize was awarded jointly to Becquerel,  my husband and me for the, discovery of radioactivity and new radioactive elements., This event greatly increased the publicity of our work. For some time, there was no more peace. Visitors and demands for lectures and articles, interrupted every day., The award of the Nobel prize was a great honor. It is also known that, the material means provided by this prize was much greater than is usual, in prizes for science. This was a great help in the continuation of our, researches. Unhappily,  we were overtired and had a succession of, failures of health for the one or the other of us,  so that it was not, until 1905 that we were able to go to Stockholm,  where my husband gave, his Nobel lecture and where we were well received., The fatigue resulting from the effort exceeding our forces,  imposed by, the unsatisfactory conditions of our labor,  was augmented by the, invasion of publicity. The overturn of our voluntary isolation was a, cause of real suffering for us and had all the effect of disaster. It, was serious trouble brought into the organization of our life,  and I, have already explained how indispensable was our freedom from external, distraction,  in order to maintain our family life and our scientific, activity. Of course,  people who contribute to that kind of trouble, generally mean it kindly. It is only that they do not realize the, conditions of the problem., In 1904 our second daughter. Eve Denise,  came to us. I had,  of course, to interrupt my work in the laboratory for a while. In the same year, because of the awarding of the Nobel prize and the general public, recognition,  a new chair of physics was created in Sorbonne,  and my, husband was named as its occupant. At the same time I was named chief of, work in the laboratory that was to be created for him. But in reality, the laboratory was not constructed then,  and only a few rooms taken from, other uses were available to us., In 1906 just as we were definitely giving up the old shed laboratory, where we had been so happy,  there came the dreadful catastrophe which, took my husband away from me and left me alone to bring up our children, and,  at the same time,  to continue our work of research., It is impossible for me to express the profoundness and importance of, the crisis brought into my life by the loss of the one who had been my, closest companion and best friend. Crushed by the blow,  I did not feel, able to face the future. I could not forget,  however,  what my husband, used sometimes to say,  that,  even deprived of him,  I ought to continue, my work., The death of my husband,  coming immediately after the general knowledge, of the discoveries with which his name is associated,  was felt by the, public,  and especially by the scientific circles,  to be a national, misfortune. It was largely under the influence of this emotion that the, Faculty of Sciences of Paris decided to offer me the chair,  as, professor,  which my husband had occupied only one year and a half in the, Sorbonne. It was an exceptional decision,  as up to then no woman had, held such a position. The University by doing this offered me a precious, mark of esteem and gave me opportunity to pursue the researches which, otherwise might have had to be abandoned. I had not expected a gift of, this kind; I never had any other ambition than to be able to work freely, for science. The honor that now came to me was deeply painful under the, cruel circumstances of its coming. Besides I wondered whether I would be, able to face such a grave responsibility. After much hesitation,  I, decided that I ought at least to try to meet the task,  and so I began in, 1906 my teaching in the Sorbonne,  as assistant professor,  and two years, later I was named titular professor., In my new situation the difficulties of my life were considerably, augmented,  as I alone had now to carry the burden formerly weighing on, my husband and me together. The cares of my young children required, close vigilance; in this,  my husband's father,  who continued to live, with us,  willingly took his share. He was happy to be occupied with the, little girls,  whose company was his chief consolation after his son's, death. By his effort and mine,  the children had a bright home,  even if, we lived with our inner grief,  which they were too young to realize. The, strong desire of my father-in-law being to live in the country,  we took, a house with a garden in Sceaux,  a suburb of Paris,  from which I could, reach the city in half an hour., This country life had great advantages,  not only for my father-in-law, who enjoyed his new surroundings,  and especially his garden,  but also, for my girls,  who had the benefit of walks in the open country. But they, were more separated from me,  and it became necessary to have a governess, for them. This position was filled first by one of my cousins,  and then, by a devoted woman who had already brought up the daughter of one of my, sisters. Both of them were Polish,  and in this way my daughters learned, my native tongue. From time to time,  some one of my Polish family came, to see me in my grief,  and we managed to meet in vacation time,  at the, seashore in France,  and once in the mountains of Poland., In 1910 we suffered the loss of my very dear father-in-law,  after a long, illness,  which brought me many sorrowful days. I used to spend at his, bedside as much time as I could,  listening to his remembrances of passed, years. His death affected deeply my elder daughter,  who,  at twelve,  knew, the value of the cheerful hours spent in his company., There were few resources for the education of my daughters in Sceaux., The youngest one,  a small child,  needed principally a hygienic life, outdoor walks and quite elementary schooling. She had already shown a, vivid intelligence and an unusual disposition for music. Her elder, sister resembled her father in the form of her intelligence. She was not, quick,  but one could already see that she had a gift of reasoning power, and that she would like science. She had some training in a private, school in Paris,  but I had not wanted to keep her in a lycée,  as I have, always found the class hours in these schools too long for the health of, the children., My view is that in the education of children the requirement of their, growth and physical evolution should be respected,  and that some time, should be left for their artistic culture. In most schools,  as they, exist to-day,  the time spent in various reading and writing exercises is, too great,  and the study required to be done at home too much. I also, find these schools lacking,  in general,  in practical exercises to, accompany the scientific studies., With a few friends in the university circle who shared these views,  we, organized,  therefore,  a cooperative group for the education of our, children,  each of us taking charge of the teaching of a particular, subject to all of the young people. We were all very busy with other, things,  and the children varied in age. Nevertheless,  the little, experiment thus made was very interesting. With a small number of, classes we yet succeeded in reuniting the scientific and literary, elements of a desirable culture. The courses in science were accompanied, by practical exercises in which the children took great interest., This arrangement,  which lasted two years,  proved to be very beneficial, for most of the children; it was certainly so for my elder daughter., Following this preparation,  she was able to enter a higher class in one, of the, collèges, of Paris,  and had no difficulty in passing her, bachelor's examination before the usual age,  after which she continued, her scientific studies in the Sorbonne., My second daughter,  although not benefiting by a similar arrangement for, her earlier studies,  at first followed the classes of a, collège, only, partially,  and later completely. She showed herself a good pupil,  doing, satisfactory work in all directions., I wanted very much to assure for my children a rational physical, education. Next to outdoor walks,  I attach a great importance to, gymnastics and sports. This side of a girl's education is still rather, neglected in France. I took care that my children did gymnastics, regularly. I was also careful to have them spend vacations either in the, mountains or at the seashore. They can canoe and swim very well and are, not afraid of a long walk or a bicycle ride., But of course the care of my children's education was only a part of my, duties,  my professional occupations taking most of my time. I have been, frequently questioned,  especially by women,  how I could reconcile family, life with a scientific career. Well,  it has not been easy; it required a, great deal of decision and of self-sacrifice. However,  the family bond, has been preserved between me and my now grown-up daughters,  and life is, made brighter by the mutual affection and understanding in our home, where I could not suffer a harsh word or selfish behavior., In 1906,  when I succeeded my husband at the Sorbonne,  I had only a, provisional laboratory with little space and most limited equipment. A, few scientists and students had already been admitted to work there with, my husband and me. With their help,  I was able to continue the course of, research with good success., In 1907,  I received a precious mark of sympathy from Mr. Andrew, Carnegie,  who donated to my laboratory an annual income for research, fellowships which enabled some advanced students or scientists to devote, their whole time to investigation. Such foundations are very encouraging, to those whose inclinations and talents are such as to warrant their, entire devotion to research work. They ought to be multiplied in the, interest of science., As for myself,  I had to devote again a great deal of time to the, preparation of several decigrammes of very pure radium chloride. With, this I achieved,  in 1907,  a new determination of the atomic weight of, radium,  and in 1910 I was able to isolate the metal. The operation,  an, extremely delicate one,  was performed with the assistance of a, distinguished chemist belonging to the laboratory staff. It has never, been repeated since that time,  because it involves a serious danger of, loss of radium,  which can be avoided only with utmost care. So I saw at, last the mysterious white metal,  but could not keep it in this state, for it was required for further experiments., As for the polonium,  I have not been able to isolate it,  its quantity in, the mineral being even much less than the quantity of radium. However, very concentrated polonium has been prepared in my laboratory,  and, important experiments have been performed with this substance, concerning especially the production of helium by radiation of polonium., I had to devote special care to the improvement of the measuring methods, in the laboratory. I have told how important precise measurements were, in the discovery of radium. It is still to be hoped that efficient, methods of quantitative determination may lead to new discoveries., I devised a very satisfactory method for determining the quantity of, radium by the means of a radioactive gas produced by it and called, ""emanation."" This method,  frequently used in my laboratory,  permits of, the measurement of very small quantities of radium (less than a, thousandth of a milligramme),  with a fair precision. More important, quantities are often measured by their penetrating radiation,  named, Gamma-rays. For this we also possess in my laboratory a suitable, equipment. It is easier and more satisfactory to measure the radium by, the emitted rays,  than to weigh it in a balance. However,  these, measurements require the disposition of reliable standards. So the, question of a radium standard had to be taken into careful, consideration., The measurements of radium had to be established on a solid basis,  for, the benefit of laboratories and scientific research,  which,  of course, is in itself an important reason,  and moreover,  the growing medical, utilization of this substance made it necessary to control the relative, purity of commercially produced radium., The first experiments on the biological properties of radium were, successfully made in France with samples from our laboratory,  while my, husband was living. The results were,  at once,  encouraging,  so that the, new branch of medical science,  called radiumtherapy (in France, Curietherapy, ),  developed rapidly,  first in France and later in other, countries. To supply the radium wanted for this purpose,  a, radium-producing industry was established. The first plant was created, in France and worked very successfully,  but afterwards manufactures were, founded in other countries,  the most important of which are now in, America,  where great quantities of radium ore,  named ""carnotite, "" are, available. The radiumtherapy and the radium production developed, conjointly,  and the results were more and more important,  for the, treatment of several diseases,  and particularly of cancer. As a, consequence of this,  several institutes have been founded,  in the large, cities,  for the application of the new therapy. Some of these institutes, own several grammes of radium,  the commercial price of the gramme being, now about $70, 000,  the cost of production depending on the very small, proportion of radium in the ore., It may be easily understood how deeply I appreciated the privilege of, realizing that our discovery had become a benefit to mankind,  not only, through its great scientific importance,  but also by its power of, efficient action against human suffering and terrible disease. This was, indeed a splendid reward for our years of hard toil., The success of the therapy depends,  of course,  on the precise knowledge, of the quantity of radium which is used,  so that the measurements of, radium are as important for industry and for medicine as for, physicochemical research., Considering all these needs,  a commission of scientific men of different, countries was formed who agreed to take as a base an international, standard,  formed of a carefully weighed quantity of pure radium salt., Secondary standards were then to be prepared for each country,  and, compared to the basic standard by means of their radiation. I was, appointed to prepare the primary standard., This was a very delicate operation,  as the weight of the standard, sample,  quite small (about 21 milligrammes of chloride),  had to be, determined with great precision. I performed the preparation in 1911., The standard is a thin glass tube,  of a few centimeters in length, containing the pure salt which was used for the determination of atomic, weight. It was accepted by the Commission and is deposited in the, International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sèvres,  near Paris., Several secondary standards,  compared with the primary one,  have been, put into service by the Commission. In France the control of radium, tubes,  by the measurement of their radiation,  takes place in my, laboratory,  where any one may bring the radium to be tested; in the, United States this is done in the Bureau of Standards., Near the end of the year 1910,  I was proposed for the decoration of the, Légion of Honor. A similar proposal was made earlier in favor of my, husband,  who,  however,  being opposed to all honorary distinctions,  did, not accept the nomination. As my husband and I were too united in all, things for me to act differently from him in this matter,  I did not, accept the decoration,  in spite of the insistence of the Ministry. At, that time also,  several colleagues persuaded me to be a candidate for, election to the Academy of Sciences of Paris,  of which my husband was a, member during the last months of his life. I hesitated very much,  as, such a candidacy requires,  by custom,  a great number of personal visits, to Academy members. However,  I consented to offer myself a candidate, because of the advantages an election would have for my laboratory. My, candidacy provoked a vivid public interest,  especially because it, involved the question of the admission of women to the Academy. Many of, the Academicians were opposed to this in principle,  and when the, scrutiny was made,  I had a few votes less than was necessary. I do not, ever wish to renew my candidacy,  because of my strong distaste for the, personal solicitation required. I believe that all such elections should, be based wholly on a spontaneous decision,  without any personal efforts, involved,  as was the case for several Academies and Societies which made, me a member without any demand or initiative on my part., As a result of all the cares devolving on me,  I fell seriously ill at, the end of 1911,  when,  for the second time,  I received,  this time alone, the award of the Nobel prize. This was a very exceptional honor,  a high, recognition of the discovery of the new elements and of the preparation, of pure radium. Suffering though I was,  I went to Stockholm to receive, the prize. The journey was extremely painful for me. I was accompanied, by my eldest sister and my young daughter Irene. The ceremony of, delivery of the Nobel prizes is very impressive,  having the features of, a national solemnity. A most generous reception was accorded me, specially by the women of Sweden. This was a great comfort to me,  but I, was suffering so much that when I returned I had to stay in bed for, several months. This grave illness,  as well as the necessities of my, children's education,  obliged me to move my home from Sceaux to Paris., During the year 1912 I had the opportunity of collaborating in the, creation of a laboratory of radium at Warsaw. This laboratory was, founded by the Scientific Society of Warsaw which offered me its, direction. I could not leave France to go back to my native country,  but, I willingly agreed to occupy myself with the organization of the studies, in the new laboratory. In 1913,  having improved my health,  I was able to, attend an inauguration fête in Warsaw,  where a touching reception was, given,  leaving me an unforgettable memory of national sentiment which, succeeded in creating useful work under particularly difficult political, conditions., While still only partially recovered from my illness,  I renewed my, efforts for the construction of a suitable laboratory in Paris. Finally, it was arranged for,  and work began in 1912. The Pasteur Institute, wished to be associated with this laboratory,  and,  in accord with the, University,  it was decided to create an Institute of Radium,  with two, laboratories,  one of physics and one of biology,  the first to be devoted, to studies of the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive, elements,  the second to the study of their biological and medical, applications. But,  because of the lack of financial means,  the, construction work proceeded very slowly,  and was not yet entirely, finished when the war broke out in 1914., CHAPTER III, In 1914,  it happened,  as it often had in other years,  that my daughters, had left Paris for their summer vacation before me. They were, accompanied by their governess,  in whom I had all confidence,  and were, living in a small house on the seashore in Brittany,  at a place where, there were also the families of several of our good friends. My work did, not generally permit me to pass the entire vacation near them without, interruption., That year I was preparing to join them in the last days of July,  when I, was stopped by the bad political news,  with its premonitions of an, imminent military mobilization. It did not seem possible for me to leave, under these conditions,  and I waited for further events. The, mobilization was announced on August 1st,  immediately followed by, Germany's declaration of war on France. The few men of the laboratory, staff and the students were mobilized,  and I was left alone with our, mechanic who could not join the army because of a serious heart trouble., The historic events that followed are known to every one,  but only those, who lived in Paris through the days of August and September,  1914,  can, ever really know the state of mind in the capital and the quiet courage, shown by it. The mobilization was a general wave of all France passing, out to the border for the defense of the land. All our interest now, centered on the news from the front., After the uncertainties of the first days this news became more and more, grave., First,  it was the invasion of Belgium and the heroic resistance of that, little country; then the victorious march of the German army through the, valley of the Oise toward Paris; and soon the departure of the French, government to Bordeaux,  followed by the leaving of those Parisians who, could not,  or would not,  face the possible danger of German occupation., The overloaded trains took into the country a great number of people, mostly of the well-to-do class. But,  on the whole,  the people of Paris, gave a strong impression of calm and quiet decision in that fateful year, of 1914. In the end of August and the beginning of September the weather, was radiant,  and under the glorious sky of those days the great city, with its architectural treasures seemed to be particularly dear to those, who remained in it., When the danger of German attack on Paris became pressing,  I felt, obliged to put in security the supply of radium then in my laboratory, and I was charged by the government to take it to Bordeaux for safety., But I did not want to be away long,  and hence decided to return, immediately. I left by one of the trains that were carrying government, staff and baggage,  and I well remember the aspect of the national, highway which is at intervals in view from the train; it showed a long, line of motor-cars carrying their owners from the capital., Arriving at Bordeaux in the evening,  I was very embarrassed with my, heavy bag including the radium protected by lead. I was not able to, carry it and waited in a public place,  while a friendly ministry, employee who came by the same train managed to find a room for me in a, private apartment,  the hotels being overcrowded. The next morning I, hurried to put the radium in a safe place,  and succeeded,  although not, without difficulty,  in taking a military train back to Paris in the, evening of the same day. Having opportunity for exchanging a few, sentences with persons on the place who wanted to ask information from, people coming by the train,  I was interested to notice how they seemed, surprised and comforted to learn of some one who found it natural to, return to Paris., My trip back was troubled by delays; for several hours the train rested, immovable on the rails,  while the travelers accepted a little bread from, the soldiers who were provided with it. Finally arriving in Paris,  I, learned that the German army had turned; the battle of the Marne had, begun., In Paris I shared the alternating hope and grief of the inhabitants, during the course of that great battle,  and had the constant worry of, foreseeing a long separation from my children in case the Germans, succeeded in occupying the city. Yet I felt that I must stay at my post., After the successful outcome of the battle,  however,  any immediate, danger of occupation being removed,  I was able to have my daughters come, back from Brittany to Paris and again take up their studies. This was, the great desire of my children,  who did not want to stay away from me, and from their work,  even if many other families thought it wiser to, stay in the country,  far from the front., The dominant duty imposed on every one at that time was to help the, country in whatever way possible during the extreme crisis that it, faced. No general instructions to this were given to the members of the, University. It was left to each to take his own initiative and means of, action. I therefore sought to discover the most efficient way to do, useful work,  turning my scientific knowledge to most profit., During the rapid succession of events in August,  1914,  it was clearly, proved that the preparation for defense was insufficient. Public feeling, was especially aroused by the realization of the grave failings which, appeared in the organization of the Health Service. My own attention was, particularly drawn to this situation,  and I soon found a field of, activity which,  once entered upon,  absorbed the greatest part of my time, and efforts until the end of the war,  and even for some time thereafter., The work was the organization of radiologic and radiotherapeutic, services for the military hospitals. But I also had to make the change, during these difficult war years,  of my laboratory into the new building, of the Institute of Radium and to continue,  in the measure possible to, me,  regular teaching,  as well as to investigate certain problems, especially interesting the military service., It is well known that the X-rays offer surgeons and doctors extremely, useful means for the examination of the sick and wounded. They make, possible the discovery and the exact location of projectiles which have, entered the body,  and this is a great help in their extraction. These, rays also reveal lesions of bones and of the internal organs and permit, one to follow the progress of recovery from internal injuries. The use, of the X-rays during the war saved the lives of many wounded men; it, also saved many from long suffering and lasting infirmity. To all the, wounded it gave a greater chance of recovery., However,  at the beginning of the war,  the Military Board of Health had, no organization of radiology,  while the civil organization was also but, little developed. Radiologic installations existed in only a small, number of important hospitals,  and there were only a few specialists in, the large cities. The numerous new hospitals that were established all, over France in the first months of the war had,  as a rule,  no, installation for the use of X-rays., To meet this need I first gathered together all the apparatus I could, find in the laboratories and stores. With this equipment I established, in August and September,  1914,  several stations of radiology,  the, operation of which was assured by volunteer helpers to whom I gave, instruction. These stations rendered great service during the battle of, the Marne. But as they could not satisfy the needs of all the hospitals, of the Paris region,  I fitted up,  with the help of the Red Cross,  a, radiologic car. It was simply a touring motor-car,  arranged for the, transport of a complete radiologic apparatus,  together with a dynamo, that was worked by the engine of the car,  and furnished the electric, current necessary for the production of the rays. This car could come at, the call of any of the hospitals,  large or small,  in the surroundings of, Paris. Cases of urgent need were frequent,  for these hospitals had to, take care of the wounded who could not be transported to more distant, places., The first results of this work showed that it was necessary to do more., Thanks to special donations and to the help of a very efficient relief, committee called ""le Patronage National des Blessés, "" I succeeded in, developing my initiative to a considerable extent. About two hundred, radiologic installations were established or materially improved through, my efforts in the zone of the French and Belgian armies,  and in the, regions of France not occupied by the army. I was able,  besides,  to, equip in my laboratory and give to the army twenty radiologic cars. The, frames of these cars were donated by various persons who wished to be, helpful; some of them offered also the equipment. The cars were of the, greatest service to the army., These privately developed installations were particularly important in, the first two years of the war,  when the regular military service, possessed but few radiologic instruments. Later the Board of Health, created,  little by little,  a considerable radiologic service of its own, as the utility of the stations was more clearly realized owing to the, example given by private initiative. But the needs of the armies were so, great,  that my cooperation continued necessary to the end of the war, and even afterwards., I could not have accomplished this work without seeing for myself the, needs of the ambulance stations and hospitals. Thanks to the help of the, Red Cross and to the agreement of the Board of Health,  I was able to, make several journeys to the army zones and to the other parts of, France. Several times I visited the ambulance stations of the armies of, the north and in the Belgian zone,  going to Amiens,  Calais,  Dunkirk, Furnes,  and Poperinghe. I went to Verdun,  Nancy,  Luneville,  Belfort,  to, Compiegne,  and Villers-Cotterets. In the regions distant from the front, I took care of many hospitals which had to do very intensive work with, little aid. And I keep as a precious recollection of that time,  many, letters of warm recognition from those to whom I brought help in their, difficulties., The motive of my starting on a journey was usually a demand from, surgeons. I went with a radiologic car which I kept for my personal use., In examining the wounded in the hospital,  I could gain information of, the special needs of the region. When back in Paris,  I got the necessary, equipment to meet these needs and returned to install it myself,  for, very often the people on the ground could not do it. I had then to find, competent persons to handle the apparatus and show them how to do it,  in, full detail. After a few days of hard toil,  the manipulator knew enough, to work the apparatus himself,  and at the same time a large number of, wounded had been examined. In addition,  the surgeons of the region had, gained an idea of the usefulness of the radiologic examination (which, few of them knew at that time),  and friendly relations were established, which made the later development of my work much easier., On several of my trips I was accompanied by my elder daughter,  Irene, who was then seventeen years old,  and,  having finished her preparatory, studies,  was beginning higher studies at the Sorbonne. Because she, greatly desired to be useful,  she now studied nursing and learned, radiology,  and did her best to help me under the most varied, circumstances. She did ambulance work at the front between Furnes and, Ypres,  and also at Amiens,  receiving,  from the Chiefs of Service, testimonials of work satisfactorily performed and,  at the end of the, war,  a medal., Of the hospital life of those years,  we keep many a remembrance,  my, daughter and I. Traveling conditions were extraordinarily difficult; we, were often not sure of being able to press forward,  to say nothing of, the uncertainty of finding lodgings and food. However,  things always, ended in arranging themselves,  thanks to our persistence and to the good, will we met. Wherever we went I had to look after each detail myself and, see innumerable military chiefs to obtain passes and permissions for, transportation. Many a time I loaded my apparatus on to the train, myself,  with the help of the employees,  to make sure that it would go, forward instead of remaining behind several days at the station. And on, arrival I also went to extract them from the encumbered station., When I traveled with the radiologic car,  other problems presented, themselves. I had,  for instance,  to find safe places for the car,  to get, lodgings for the assistants and to secure the automobile accessories., Since chauffeurs were scarce,  I learned to drive the car,  and did it, when necessary. Owing to all this personal supervision,  my installations, were usually swiftly made,  whereas appeal to the Central Health Service, was answered slowly. So the military chiefs greatly appreciated the, assistance they could get from me,  especially in cases of urgent need., We both,  my daughter and myself,  have pleasant and grateful memories of, the personnel of the hospitals,  and were on the best terms with the, surgeons and nurses. One could not but admire these men and women who, were giving their services without counting,  and whose task was often, overwhelming. Our collaboration was easy,  for my daughter and I tried to, work in their spirit; and we felt that we were standing side by side, with friends., While we were attached to the Belgian Ambulance Service,  we were present, several times during visits of King Albert and Queen Elizabeth. We, appreciated deeply their devotion,  their solicitude for the wounded, their extreme simplicity,  and the cordiality of their behavior., But nothing was so moving as to be with the wounded and to take care of, them. We were drawn to them because of their suffering and because of, the patience with which they bore it. Almost everyone did his best to, facilitate the X-ray examination,  notwithstanding the pain caused by any, displacement. One learned very soon to know them individually and to, exchange with them a few friendly words. Those who were not familiar, with the examination,  wanted very much to be reassured about the effect, of the strange apparatus they were going to experience., I can never forget the terrible impression of all that destruction of, human life and health. To hate the very idea of war,  it ought to be, sufficient to see once what I have seen so many times,  all through those, years: men and boys brought to the advanced ambulance in a mixture of, mud and blood,  many of them dying of their injuries,  many others, recovering but slowly through months of pain and suffering., One of my difficult problems was to find the necessary trained, assistants to operate my apparatus. At the beginning of the war there, was little knowledge of radiology,  and apparatus in the hands of those, who did not understand how to handle it deteriorated quickly and was, soon useless. The practice of radiology in most hospitals in war-time, does not require much medical knowledge; it can be sufficiently grasped, by intelligent persons who know how to study and who have some notion of, electrical machinery. Professors,  engineers,  or university students, often made good manipulators. I had to look for those who were, temporarily free from military service,  or who happened to be stationed, in the locality where I needed them. But even after I had secured them, these operators were often transferred by military orders,  and I had to, search again for others to fill their places. For this reason,  I, determined to train women to do this work., Accordingly,  I proposed to the Health Service to add a department of, radiology to the Nurses' School which had just been founded at the Edith, Cavell Hospital. This they agreed to do. And so,  in 1916,  the course was, organized at the Radium Institute,  and provided in the following years, of war for the training of one hundred and fifty operators. Most of the, pupils who applied had only an elementary education,  but could succeed, if working in a proper way. The course comprised theoretical studies and, very extended practical training; it included also some instruction in, anatomy. It was given by a few persons of good will,  among them my, daughter. Our graduates formed an excellent personnel very genuinely, appreciated by the Board of Health. Theoretically,  they were supposed to, serve as aides to physicians,  but several of them proved capable of, independent work., My continued and various experience in war radiology gave me a wide, knowledge of that subject,  which I felt should be made more familiar to, the public. So I wrote a small book called ""Radiology and the War, "" in, which I aimed to demonstrate the vital importance of radiology and to, compare its development during war time with its use in the previous, time of peace., I come now to the account of the founding of the service of, radiumtherapy at the Radium Institute., In 1915,  the radium,  which had been safely deposited in Bordeaux,  was, brought back to Paris,  and not having time for regular scientific, research,  I decided to use it to cure the wounded,  without,  however, risking the loss of this precious material. I proceeded to place at the, disposal of the Health Service not the radium itself,  but the emanation, which can be obtained from it at regular intervals. The technique of the, use of the emanation can readily be employed in the larger radiumtherapy, institutes,  and,  in many ways,  is more practicable than the direct use, of radium. In France,  however,  there was no national institute of, radiumtherapy,  and the emanation was not used in hospitals., I offered to furnish regularly to the Health Service bulbs of radium, emanation. The offer was accepted,  and the ""Emanation Service, "" started, in 1916,  was continued until the end of the war and even longer. Having, no assistants,  I had,  for a long time,  to prepare these emanation bulbs, alone,  and their preparation is very delicate. Numbers of wounded and, sick,  military and civil,  were treated by means of these bulbs., During the bombardment of Paris,  the Health Board took special measures, to protect from shells the laboratory in which the bulbs were prepared., Since the handling of radium is far from being free of danger (several, times I have felt a discomfort which I consider a result of this cause), measures were taken to prevent harmful effects of the rays on the, persons preparing emanation., While the work in connection with the hospitals remained my major, interest,  I had many other preoccupations during the war., After the failure of the German offensive in the summer of 1918,  at the, request of the Italian government,  I went to Italy to study the question, of her natural resources in radioactive materials. I remained a month, and was able to obtain certain results in interesting the public, authorities in the importance of this new subject., It was in 1915 that I had to move my laboratory to the new building in, the rue Pierre Curie. This was a trying and complicated experience,  for, which,  once more,  I had no money nor any help. So it was only between my, journeys that I was able,  little by little,  to do the transportation of, my laboratory equipment,  in my radiologic cars. Afterwards,  I had much, work in classifying and distributing my materials,  and arranging the new, place in general,  with the help of my daughter and of my mechanic,  who, unfortunately,  was often ill., One of my first cares was to have trees planted in the limited grounds, of my laboratory. I feel it very necessary for the eyes to have the, comfort of fresh leaves in spring and summer time. So I tried to make, things pleasant for those who were to work in the new building. We, planted a few lime trees and plane trees,  as many as there was room for, and did not forget flowerbeds and roses. I well remember the first day, of bombardment of Paris with the big German gun; we had gone,  in the, early morning,  to the flower-market,  and spent all that day busy with, our plantation,  while a few shells fell in the vicinity., In spite of the great difficulties,  the new laboratory was organized, little by little,  and I had the satisfaction of having it quite ready, for the beginning of the school-year 1919-20,  the period of, demobilization. In the spring of 1919,  I organized special courses for, some American soldier students,  who also studied with much zeal the, practical exercises directed by my daughter., Mme. Curie instructing American soldiers in her Paris laboratory., Photo by U. S. Signal Corps., The entire period of the war was for me,  as for many others,  a period of, great fatigue. I took almost no vacation,  except for a few days,  now and, then,  when I went to see my daughters on their holidays. My older, daughter would scarcely take any,  and I was obliged to send her away, sometimes to preserve her health. She was continuing her studies in the, Sorbonne,  and besides,  as said before,  was helping me with my war work, while the younger daughter was still in the preparatory college. Neither, of them wished to leave Paris during the bombardment., After more than four years of a war which caused ravages without, precedent,  the armistice came at last,  in the autumn of 1918,  followed, by laborious efforts to reëstablish peace,  which is not yet general nor, complete. It was a great relief to France to see the end of that dark, period of cruel losses. But the griefs are too recent and life still too, hard for calm and happiness yet to be restored., Nevertheless,  a great joy came to me as a consequence of the victory, obtained by the sacrifice of so many human lives. I had lived,  though I, had scarcely expected it,  to see the reparation of more than a century, of injustice that had been done to Poland,  my native country,  and that, had kept her in slavery,  her territories and people divided among her, enemies. It was a deserved resurrection for the Polish nation,  which, showed herself faithful to her national memories during the long period, of oppression,  almost without hope. The dream that appeared so difficult, to realize,  although so dear,  became a reality following the storm that, swept over Europe. In these new conditions I went to Warsaw and saw my, family again,  after many years of separation,  in the capital of free, Poland. But how difficult are the conditions of life of the new Polish, republic,  and how complicated is the problem of reorganization after so, many years of abnormal life!, In France,  partly devastated and suffering from the loss of so many of, her citizens,  the difficulties created by the war are not yet effaced, and the return to normal work is being attained only gradually. The, scientific laboratories feel this state of affairs and the same, condition prevails for the Radium Institute., The various radiologic organizations created during the war still, partially exist. The Radiographic Nurses' School has been maintained at, the request of the Board of Health. The emanation service,  which could, not be abandoned,  is also continued in a considerably enlarged form. It, has passed under the direction of Doctor Regaud,  Director of the Pasteur, Laboratory of the Radium Institute,  and is developing into a great, national service of radiumtherapy., The work of the laboratory has been reorganized,  with the return of the, mobilized personnel and the students. But in the restrained, circumstances under which the country still exists,  the laboratory lacks, ways and means for its efficient development. Particularly are wanted an, independent hospital for radiumtherapy (which is called, Curietherapy, in France),  and an experimental station,  outside of Paris,  for, experiments on great quantities of material,  such as are needed for the, progress of our knowledge of radioactive elements., I myself am no longer young,  and I frequently ask myself whether,  in, spite of recent efforts of the government aided by some private, donations,  I shall ever succeed in building up for those who will come, after me an Institute of Radium,  such as I wish to the memory of Pierre, Curie and to the highest interest of humanity., However,  a precious encouragement came to me in the year 1921. On the, initiative of a generous daughter of the United States,  Mrs. W. B., Meloney,  the women of that great American country collected a fund,  the, ""Marie Curie Radium Fund, "" and offered me the gift of a gramme of radium, to be placed entirely at my disposal for scientific research. Mrs., Meloney invited me with my daughters to come to America and to receive, the gift,  or the symbol of it,  from the hands of the President of the, great republic,  at the White House., The fund was collected by a public subscription,  as well by small as by, important gifts,  and I was very thankful to my sisters of America for, this genuine proof of their affection. So I started for New York at the, beginning of May,  after a ceremony given in my honor at the Opera of, Paris,  to greet me before my departing., I keep a grateful memory of my sojourn in the United States for several, weeks,  of the impressive reception at the White House,  where President, Harding addressed me in generous and affectionate words,  of my visits to, the universities and colleges which welcomed me and bestowed on me their, honorary degrees,  of the public reunions where I could not but feel the, deep sympathy of those who came to meet me and to wish me good luck., Madame Curie in her laboratory at the Institut Curie,  Paris., Henri Manuel,  Paris., I had also the opportunity of a visit to the Niagara Falls and to the, Grand Canyon,  and admired immensely these marvelous creations of nature., Unhappily,  the precarious state of my health did not permit of the, complete fulfilment of the general plan established by my visit to, America. However,  I saw and learned much,  and my daughters enjoyed to a, full extent the opportunities of their unexpected vacation and the pride, in the recognition of their mother's work. We left for Europe at the end, of June,  with the real sorrow of parting from excellent friends whom we, would not forget., I came back to my work,  made easier by the precious gift,  with an even, stronger desire to carry it forward with renewed courage. But as my aims, are still wanting support in essential parts,  I am frequently compelled, to give thought to a very fundamental question concerning the view a, scientist ought to take of his discovery., My husband,  as well as myself,  always refused to draw from our discovery, any material profit. We have published,  since the beginning,  without any, reserve,  the process that we used to prepare the radium. We took out no, patent and we did not reserve any advantage in any industrial, exploitation. No detail was kept secret,  and it is due to the, information we gave in our publications that the industry of radium has, been rapidly developed. Up to the present time this industry hardly uses, any methods except those established by us. The treatment of the, minerals and the fractional crystallizations are still performed in the, same way,  as I did it in my laboratory,  even if the material means are, increased., As for the radium prepared by me out of the ore we managed to obtain in, the first years of our work,  I have given it all to my laboratory., The price of radium is very high since it is found in minerals in very, small quantities,  and the profits of its manufacture have been great,  as, this substance is used to cure a number of diseases. So it is a fortune, which we have sacrificed in renouncing the exploitation of our, discovery,  a fortune that could,  after us,  have gone to our children., But what is even more to be considered is the objection of many of our, friends,  who have argued,  not without reason,  that if we had guaranteed, our rights,  we could have had the financial means of founding a, satisfactory Institute of Radium,  without experiencing any of the, difficulties that have been such a handicap to both of us,  and are still, a handicap to me. Yet,  I still believe that we have done right., Humanity,  surely,  needs practical men who make the best of their work, for the sake of their own interests,  without forgetting the general, interest. But it also needs dreamers,  for whom the unselfish following, of a purpose is so imperative that it becomes impossible for them to, devote much attention to their own material benefit. No doubt it could, be said that these idealists do not deserve riches since they do not, have the desire for them. It seems,  however,  that a society well, organized ought to assure to these workers the means for efficient, labor,  in a life from which material care is excluded so that this life, may be freely devoted to the service of scientific research., CHAPTER IV, A VISIT TO AMERICA, My beautiful voyage to the United States of America resulted,  as is, known,  from the generous initiative of an American woman,  Mrs. Meloney, editor of an important magazine,  the, Delineator,  who,  having planned, the gift of a gramme of radium to me by her countrywomen,  succeeded in a, few months in bringing this plan to execution,  and asked me to come over, and receive the gift personally., The idea was that the gift would come exclusively from the American, women. A committee including several prominent women and distinguished, scientific men received some important gifts,  and made an appeal for a, public subscription,  to which a great number of women's organizations, especially colleges and clubs,  responded. In many cases gifts came from, persons who had experienced the benefit of radiumtherapy. In this way, was collected the ""Marie Curie Radium Fund"" of more than one hundred, thousand dollars for the purchase of a gramme of radium. The President, of the United States,  Mr. Harding,  kindly agreed to deliver the gift in, a ceremony at the White House., The Committee invited me and my daughters to the United States in May, and even though it was not vacation time for me,  I accepted the, invitation with the consent of the University of Paris., All care of the voyage was taken away from me. Mrs. Meloney came to, France in time to be present at a manifestation organized on the 28th of, April in favor of the Radium Institute of Paris by the magazine, Je Sais, Tout,  and accompanied by sincere expressions of sympathy for the, American nation. On May 4th,  we took passage at Cherbourg on the, Olympic, for New York., The program of my voyage prepared by the Committee seemed very, intimidating. It was announced that I would not only attend the ceremony, at the White House,  but also visit many universities and colleges in, several towns. Some of these institutions had contributed to the Fund;, all desired to offer me honors. The vitality and the activity of the, American nation produces programs on a large scale. On the other hand, the wideness of the country has developed in American citizens the, custom of long travel. But during all that travel I was protected with, the greatest care,  in order to lighten as far as possible the inevitable, fatigue of the voyage and the receptions. America not only gave me a, generous welcome,  but also true friends whom I could not thank enough, for their kindness and their devotion., After having admired the grand view of the harbors of New York,  and, having been greeted by groups of students,  Girl Scouts,  and Polish, delegates,  and welcomed by many gifts of flowers,  we took possession of, a peaceful apartment in town. The following day I made the acquaintance, of the Reception Committee at a luncheon given by Mrs. Carnegie in her, beautiful home still filled with memories of her husband,  Andrew, Carnegie,  whose philanthropic achievements are well known in France. The, following day we went for a visit of a few days to Smith College,  and, Vassar College,  a few hours from New York. Later I also visited the, colleges of Bryn Mawr and Wellesley,  and I saw some others on my way., These colleges,  or universities for women,  are very characteristic of, American life and culture. My short visit could not permit me to give an, authorized opinion on the intellectual training,  but even in such a, visit as I made one may notice important differences between the French, and American conception of girls' education,  and some of these, differences would not be in favor of our country. Two points have, particularly drawn my attention: the care of the health and the physical, development of the students,  and the very independent organization of, their life which allows a large degree of individual initiative., The colleges are excellent in their construction and organization. They, are composed of several buildings,  often scattered in very large grounds, between lawns and trees. Smith is on the shore of a charming river. The, equipment is comfortable and hygienic,  of extreme cleanliness,  with, bathrooms,  showers,  distribution of cold and hot water. The students, have cheerful private rooms and common gathering rooms. A very complete, organization of games and sports exists in every college. The students, play tennis and baseball; they have gymnasium,  canoeing,  swimming,  and, horseback riding. Their health is under the constant care of medical, advisers. It seems to be a frequent opinion of American mothers that the, existing atmosphere of cities like New York is not favorable to the, education of young girls,  and that a life in the country in the open air, gives more suitable conditions for the health and the tranquillity of, studying., In every college the young girls form an association and elect a, committee which has to establish the internal rules of the college. The, students display a great activity: they take part in educational work;, they publish a paper; they are devoted to songs and music; they write, plays,  and act them in college and out of it. These plays have, interested me very much in their subjects and the execution. The, students are also of different social conditions. Many of them are of, wealthy families,  but many others live on scholarships. The whole, organization may be considered as democratic. A few students are, foreigners,  and we have met some French students very well pleased with, the college life and the studies., Every college takes four years of study with examinations from time to, time. Some students afterwards do personal work,  and acquire the degree, of Doctor,  which does not exactly correspond to the same title in, France. The colleges have laboratories with many good facilities for, experimentation., I have been strongly impressed by the joy of life animating these young, girls and expanding on every occasion,  like that of one of my visit. If, the ceremonies of the reception were performed in a nearly military, order,  a spontaneity of youth and happiness expressed itself in the, songs of greeting composed by the students,  in the smiling and excited, faces,  and in the rushing over the lawns to greet me at my arrival. This, was indeed a charming impression which I could not forget., Back in New York,  several ceremonies awaited me before my leaving for, Washington. A luncheon of the Chemists,  a reception at the Museum of, Natural History and the Mineralogical Club,  a dinner at the Institute of, Social Sciences,  and a great meeting at Carnegie Hall,  where many, delegations represented the faculties and students of women's colleges, and universities. At all these receptions I was greeted in warm, addresses by prominent men and women,  and I received honors very, precious to me because of the sincerity of the givers. Neither has the, part of national friendships been forgotten; the address of, Vice-President Coolidge was a noble recognition of the past where French, and Polish citizens have been helpful to the young American Republic, and is also a statement of fraternity strengthened by the tempest of the, last years., It was in this atmosphere of affection created by the convergence of, intellectual and social sympathies that there took place on May 20th the, beautiful ceremony at the White House. It was a deeply moving ceremony, in all its simplicity,  occurring before a democratic gathering including, the President and Mrs. Harding,  cabinet officers,  Judges of the Supreme, Court,  high officers of Army and Navy,  foreign diplomats, representatives of women's clubs and societies,  and prominent citizens, of Washington and other cities. It comprised a short presentation by the, French ambassador,  M. Jusserand,  a speech by Mrs. Meloney for the, American women,  the address of President Harding,  a few words of, gratitude said by me,  a defile of the guests,  and a group picture for a, souvenir,  all this in the admirable setting of the White House,  peaceful, and dignified,  white indeed between its green lawns with wide prospects, on that beautiful afternoon of May. A remembrance never to be forgotten, was left by this reception in which the chief representative of a great, nation offered me homage of infinite value,  the testimonial of the, recognition of his country's citizens., The address of the President had been inspired by the same sentiments as, that of Vice-President Coolidge,  as far as concerned his appreciation of, France and Poland. This address gave also an expression of the American, feeling which was emphasized by an exceptional solemnity in the, delivering of the gift., Mme. Curie and President Harding at the White House,  May 20,  1921,  when, a gram of radium was presented to its discoverer by the women of, America., Copyright International., The American nation is generous,  and always ready to appreciate an, action inspired by considerations of general interest. If the discovery, of radium has so much sympathy in America,  it is not only because of its, scientific value,  and of the importance of medical utilization; it is, also because the discovery has been given to humanity without, reservation or material benefits to the discoverers. Our American, friends wanted to honor this spirit animating the French science., The radium itself was not brought to the ceremony. The President, presented me with the symbol of the gift,  a small golden key opening the, casket devised for the transportation of the radium., Our sojourn at Washington following the principal ceremony included a, very agreeable reception at the French Embassy and the Polish Legation, a reception at the National Museum,  and some laboratory visits., The itinerary of our journey from Washington included visits to the, cities of Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh,  Chicago,  Buffalo,  Boston,  and New, Haven,  a visit to the Grand Canyon,  and to Niagara Falls. On that trip I, was the guest of several universities which did me the honor of, bestowing honorary degrees on me. I have to thank for these the, universities of Pennsylvania,  of Pittsburgh,  of Chicago,  the, Northwestern University,  Columbia University,  Yale University,  the, Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania,  the University of Pennsylvania, Smith College,  and Wellesley College,  while I thank Harvard University, for her reception., The delivery of honorary degrees in American universities is accompanied, by solemnities. In principle,  the presence of the candidate is required, and the delivery takes place at the annual commencement,  but,  in some, cases,  special ceremonies were organized in my favor. The university, ceremonies in America are more frequent than in France,  and play a more, important part in the university life. Especially is this true at the, annual commencement,  which begins with an academic procession over the, grounds of the university,  the procession including the officials,  the, professors,  and graduates in academic caps and gowns. Afterwards all, assemble in a hall where are announced the diplomas corresponding to the, grades of bachelor,  master,  and doctor. There is always a musical part, in the program,  and addresses are delivered by the officials of the, university or invited orators. These addresses are naturally devoted to, dignifying the ideals and the humanitarian purposes of education; but in, certain cases it seems permitted to introduced point of American humor., These ceremonies are on the whole very impressive,  and certainly, contribute to keep a bond between the university and the alumni. This is, a favorable circumstance for those great American universities which are, sustained entirely on private foundations. It is only in more recent, times that most States have created universities supported by the State., At Yale University I had the pleasure of representing the University of, Paris at the inauguration of President Angell,  fourteenth president of, the University. I was also pleased to attend at Philadelphia a meeting, of the American Philosophical Society and a meeting of the College of, Physicians,  and at Chicago a meeting of the American Chemical Society at, which I delivered a lecture on the Discovery of Radium. The medals of, John Scott,  Benjamin Franklin,  and Willard Gibbs have been presented to, me by these societies., Several meetings organized in my honor by the American women's, organizations have particularly interested the American public. I have, already mentioned the meeting of the University Women at Carnegie Hall, of New York; a similar meeting was held at Chicago,  where I was also, received by the Association of Polish Women. I was also greeted by, women's organizations in the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh,  and by a, delegation of Canadian university women at Buffalo. In all these, meetings it was impossible not to recognize the sincerity of the emotion, in the women who gave me their best wishes,  at the same time expressing, their confidence in the future of feminine intelligence and activity. I, did not feel any opposition between these feministic aspirations and the, masculine opinion. As far as I could notice,  the men in America approve, of these aspirations and encourage them. This is a very favorable, condition for the social activity of the American women which reveals, itself in a strong interest in work for education,  for hygiene,  and for, the improvement of conditions of labor. But any other unselfish purpose, may rely on their support,  as is proved by the success of Mrs. Meloney's, plan,  and by the sympathy this plan encountered in women of all social, conditions., I could not,  to my deep regret,  give time enough to the visit to, laboratories and scientific institutes. These too brief visits were of, great interest to me. I found everywhere the greatest care for, developing scientific activity and for improving the facilities. New, laboratories are in building,  and in older laboratories very modern, equipment may be found. The available room never gives that impression, of insufficiency from which we suffer too often in France. The means are, provided by private initiative expressed in gifts and foundations of, various kinds. There exists also a National Council of Research, established by private funds for stimulating and improving scientific, work,  and for assuring its connection with industry., I have visited with special interest the Bureau of Standards,  a very, important national institution at Washington for scientific measurements, and for study connected with them. The tubes of radium presented to me, were at the Bureau,  whose officials had kindly offered to make the, measurements,  and to take care of the packing and delivery to the ship., A new laboratory has been created at Washington for researches on very, low temperatures with the use of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium. I, had the honor of dedicating this laboratory to its service., I had the great pleasure of meeting in their laboratories several very, important American scientific men. The hours I spent in their company, are among the best of my travel., The United States possesses several hospitals for radiumtherapy. These, hospitals are generally provided with laboratories for the extraction of, radium emanation which is sealed up in small tubes for medical use., These institutions own important quantities of radium,  have a very good, equipment,  and treat a great number of patients. I have visited some of, them,  and this made me feel more deeply,  if possible,  the regret of not, having in France even one national institute capable of rendering the, same services. I hope that this lack will be filled in the near future., The industry of radium has been started in France,  but it is in America, that it has had its greatest development,  owing to the presence of a, sufficient supply of the ore carnotite., [15], I was very much interested, in my visit to the most important of the factories,  and I gladly, recognize the spirit of initiative in this undertaking. The factory owns, a collection of documentary films which enable one to appreciate the, effort made each day in collecting the ore scattered in the immense, fields of Colorado,  in carrying and concentrating this ore originally, very poor in radium. On the other hand,  the means of extraction of, radium are still the same which have been described in earlier chapters., The greatest courtesy was paid me in my visit to the radium plant and, laboratory. I found the same reception at a factory of mesothorium which, presented me with some material,  and where the officials expressed the, desire to help in my scientific work., To make complete these travel impressions it would be necessary to speak, of the nature of the country. I recoil before the task,  being incapable, of expressing in a few words the immensity and the variety of the spaces, which opened before my eyes. The general impression is one of unlimited, possibilities for the future. I keep a particularly vivid remembrance of, the great falls of Niagara,  and of the magnificent colors of the Grand, Canyon., On June 28th I embarked in New York on the same ship which had brought, me to the United States less than two months before. I would not take, the liberty,  after so short a period of time,  of giving an opinion on, America and the Americans. I would only say how deeply I have been, touched by the warm reception which was tendered everywhere to me and my, daughters. Our hosts wanted to make us feel that we were not with, strangers; and,  on the other hand,  many of them assured me that they, felt in entirely friendly surroundings when on the soil of France. I got, back to France with a feeling of gratitude for the precious gift of the, American women,  and with a feeling of affection for their great country, tied with ours by a mutual sympathy which gives confidence in a peaceful, future for humanity., [15], Quite recently there has been started near Anverst an, important radium industry as a result of the discovery of uranium ore in, the Belgian Congo., *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PIERRE CURIE ***, Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will, be renamed., Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright, law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United, States without permission and without paying copyright, royalties.

I began these researches, by a study of the phosphorescence of uranium,  discovered, by M. Becquerel. The results to which I was led by this, work promised to afford so interesting a field that M. Curie, put aside the work on which he was engaged,  and joined, me,  our object being the extraction of new radio-active, substances and the further study of their properties., Since the commencement of our research we thought it, well to hand over specimens of the substances,  discovered, and prepared by ourselves,  to certain physicists,  in the first, place to M. Becquerel,  to whom is due the discovery of the, uranium rays. In this way we ourselves facilitated the, research by others besides ourselves on the new radio-active, bodies. At the termination of our first publications,  M., Giesel,  in Germany,  also began to prepare these substances, and passed on specimens of them to several German, scientists. Finally,  these substances were placed on sale in, France and Germany,  and the subject growing in importance, gave rise to a scientific movement,  such that numerous, memoirs have appeared,  and are constantly appearing on, radio-active bodies,  principally abroad. The results of the, various French and foreign researches are necessarily confused, as is the case with all new subjects in course of, investigation,  the aspect of the question becoming modified, from day to day., From the chemical point of view,  however,  one point is, definitely established:—, i.e.,  the existence of a new element, strongly radio-active,  viz.,  radium. The preparation of the, 4, pure chloride of radium and the determination of the atomic, weight of radium form the chief part of my own work., Whilst this work adds to the elements actually known with, certainty a new element with very curious properties,  a new, method of chemical research is at the same time established, and justified. This method,  based on the consideration of, radio-activity as an atomic property of matter,  is just that, which enabled M. Curie and myself to discover the existence, of radium., If,  from the chemical point of view,  the question that we, undertook primarily may be looked upon as solved,  the, study of the physical properties of the radio-active bodies is, in full evolution. Certain important points have been, established,  but a large number of the conclusions are still, of a provisional character. This is not surprising when we, consider the complexity of the phenomena due to radio-activity, and the differences existing between the various, radio-active substances. The researches of physicists on, these substances constantly meet and overlap. Whilst, endeavouring to keep strictly to the limits of this work and, to publish my individual research only,  I have been obliged, at the same time to mention results of other researches,  the, knowledge of which is indispensable., I desired,  moreover,  to make this work an inclusive, survey of the actual position of the question., I indicate at the end the particular questions with which, I am specially concerned,  and those which I investigated in, conjunction with M. Curie., I carried on the work in the laboratories of the School of, Physics and Chemistry in Paris,  with the permission of, Schützenberger,  late Director of the School,  and M. Lauth, actual Director. I take this opportunity of expressing my, gratitude for the kind hospitality received in this school., Historical., The discovery of the phenomena of radio-activity is connected, with researches followed,  since the discovery of the, Röntgen rays,  upon the photographic effects of phosphorescent, and fluorescent substances., The first tubes for producing Röntgen rays were without, the metallic anticathode. The source of the Röntgen rays, was the glass surface impinged upon by the cathode rays;, this surface was at the same time actively fluorescent. The, question then was whether the emission of Röntgen rays, necessarily accompanied the production of fluorescence, 5, whatever might be the cause of the latter. This idea was, first enunciated by M. Henri Poincaré., Shortly afterwards,  M. Henry announced that he had, obtained photographic impressions through black paper by, means of phosphorescent zinc sulphide. M. Niewenglowski, obtained the same phenomenon with calcium sulphide exposed, to the light. Finally,  M. Troost obtained strong, photographic impressions with zinc sulphide artificially, phosphorescent acting across black paper and thick cardboard., The experiences just cited have not been reproduced,  in, spite of numerous attempts to this end. It cannot therefore, be considered as proved that zinc sulphide and calcium, sulphide are capable of emitting,  under the action of light, invisible rays which traverse black paper and act on photographic, plates., M. Becquerel has made similar experiments on the salts, of uranium,  some of which are fluorescent., He obtained photographic impressions through black, paper with the double sulphate of uranium and potassium., M. Becquerel at first believed that this salt,  which is, fluorescent,  behaved like the sulphides of zinc and calcium, in the experiments of MM. Henry,  Niewenglowski,  and, Troost. But the conclusion of his experiments showed, that the phenomenon observed was in no way related to, the fluorescence. It is not necessary that the salt should, be fluorescent; further,  uranium and all its compounds, fluorescent or not,  act in the same manner,  and metallic, uranium is the most active. M. Becquerel finally found, that by placing uranium compounds in complete darkness, they continue acting on photographic plates through black, paper for years. M. Becquerel allows that uranium and, its compounds emit peculiar rays—uranium rays. He, proved that these rays can penetrate thin metallic screens, and that they discharge electrified bodies. He also made, experiments from which he concluded that uranium rays, undergo reflection,  refraction,  and polarisation., The work of other physicists (Elster and Geitel,  Lord, Kelvin,  Schmidt,  Rutherford,  Beattie,  and Smoluchowski), confirms and extends the results of the researches of M., Becquerel,  with the exception of those relating to the reflection, refraction,  and polarisation of uranium rays,  which, in this respect behave like Röntgen rays,  as has been recognised, first by Mr. Rutherford and then by M. Becquerel, himself., 6, CHAPTER I., Radio-activity of Uranium and Thorium. Radio-active Minerals., Becquerel Rays., —The uranium rays discovered by M., Becquerel act upon photographic plates screened from the, light; they can penetrate all solid,  liquid,  and gaseous substances, provided that the thickness is sufficiently reduced;, in passing through a gas,  they cause it to become a feeble, conductor of electricity., These properties of the uranium compounds are not due, to any known cause. The radiation seems to be spontaneous;, it loses nothing in intensity,  even on keeping the, compounds in complete darkness for several years; hence, there is no question of the phosphorescence being specially, produced by light., The spontaneity and persistence of the uranium radiation, appear as a quite unique physical phenomenon. M., Becquerel kept a piece of uranium for several years in the, dark,  and he has affirmed that at the end of this time the, action upon a photographic plate had not sensibly altered., MM. Elster and Geitel made a similar experiment,  and also, found the action to remain constant., I measured the intensity of radiation of uranium by the, effect of this radiation on the conductivity of air. The, method of measurement will be explained later. I also, obtained figures which prove the persistence of radiation, within the limits of accuracy of the experiments., For these measurements a metallic plate was used, covered with a layer of powdered uranium; this plate was, not otherwise kept in the dark; this precaution,  according, to the experimenters already quoted,  being of no importance., The number of measurements taken with this plate is, very great,  and they actually extend over a period of five, years., Some researches were conducted to discover whether, other substances were capable of acting similarly to the, uranium compounds. M. Schmidt was the first to publish, that thorium and its compounds possess exactly the same, property. A similar research,  made contemporaneously, gave me the same result. I published this not knowing at, the time of Schmidt’s publication., We shall say that uranium,  thorium,  and their compounds, emit, Becquerel rays, . I have called, radio-active, those substances which generate emissions of this nature., This name has since been adopted generally., 7, In their photographic and electric effects,  the Becquerel, rays approximate to the Röntgen rays. They also,  like the, latter,  possess the faculty of penetrating all matter. But, their capacity for penetration is very different; the rays of, uranium and of thorium are arrested by some millimetres of, solid matter,  and cannot traverse in air a distance greater, than a few centimetres; this at least is the case for the, greater part of the radiation., The researches of different physicists,  and primarily of, Mr. Rutherford,  have shown that the Becquerel rays, undergo neither regular reflection,  nor refraction,  nor, polarisation., The feeble penetrating power of uranium and thorium, rays would point to their similarity to the secondary rays, produced by the Röntgen rays,  and which have been investigated, by M. Sagnac,  rather than to the Röntgen rays, themselves., For the rest,  the Becquerel rays might be classified as, cathode rays propagated in the air. It is now known that, these different analogies are all legitimate., Measurement of the Intensity of Radiation., Fig. 1., The method employed consists in measuring the conductivity, acquired by air under the action of radio-active, bodies; this method possesses the advantage of being rapid, and of furnishing, figures which are, comparable. The apparatus, employed by, me for the purpose, consists essentially of, a plate condenser, A B, (Fig. 1). The, active body,  finely, powered,  is spread, over the plate, B, making the air between, the plates a, conductor. In order, to measure the conductivity, the plate, B, is raised to a high potential by connecting it with one pole of, a battery of small accumulators, P,  of which the other pole is, connected to earth. The plate, A, being maintained at the, potential of the earth by the connection, C D,  an electric current, is set up between the two plates. The potential of plate, A, is, 8, recorded by an electrometer, E, . If the earth connection be, broken at, C,  the plate, A, becomes charged,  and this charge, causes a deflection of the electrometer. The velocity of, the deflection is proportional to the intensity of the current, and serves to measure the latter., But a preferable method of measurement is that of compensating, the charge on plate, A,  so as to cause no deflection, of the electrometer. The charges in question are, extremely weak; they may be compensated by means of a, quartz electric balance, Q,  one sheath of which is connected, to plate, A, and the other to earth. The quartz lamina is, subjected to a known tension,  produced by placing weights, in a plate,  π; the tension is produced progressively,  and, has the effect of generating progressively a known quantity, of electricity during the time observed. The operation can, be so regulated that,  at each instant,  there is compensation, between the quantity of electricity that traverses the condenser, and that of the opposite kind furnished by the, quartz. In this way,  the quantity of electricity passing, through the condenser for a given time, i.e.,  the, intensity, of the current,  can be measured, in absolute units, . The, measurement is independent of the sensitiveness of the, electrometer., In carrying out a certain number of measurements of this, kind,  it is seen that radio-activity is a phenomenon capable, of being measured with a certain accuracy. It varies little, with temperature; it is scarcely affected by variations in, the temperature of the surroundings; it is not influenced, by incandescence of the active substance. The intensity, of the current which traverses the condenser increases with, the surface of the plates. For a given condenser and a, given substance the current increases with the difference, of potential between the plates,  with the pressure of the gas, which fills the condenser,  and with the distance of the plates, (provided this distance be not too great in comparison with, the diameter). In every case,  for great differences of, potential the current attains a limiting value,  which is, practically constant. This is the, current of saturation,  or, limiting current, . Similarly,  for a certain sufficiently great, distance between the plates the current hardly varies any, longer with the distance. It is the current obtained under, these conditions that was taken as the measure of radio-activity, in my researches,  the condenser being placed in air, at atmospheric pressure., I append curves which represent the intensity of the, current as a function of the field established between the, 9, plates for two different plate distances. Plate, B, was, covered with a thin layer of powdered metallic uranium;, plate, A,  connected with the electrometer,  was provided with, a guard-ring., Fig. 2., Fig. 3., Fig. 2 shows that the intensity of the current becomes, constant for high potential differences between the plates., Fig. 3 represents the same curves on another scale,  and, comprehends only relative results for small differences of, potential. At the origin,  the curve is rectilinear; the, ratio of the intensity of the current to the difference of, 10, potential is constant for weak forces,  and represents the, initial conduction between the plates. Two important, characteristic constants of the observed phenomenon are, therefore to be recognised:—(1) The, initial conduction, for, small differences of potential; (2) the, limiting current, for, great potential differences. The limiting current has been, adopted as the measure of the radio-activity., Besides the difference of potential established between, the two plates,  there exists between them an electromotive, force of contact,  and these two sources of current, combine their effects; for this reason,  the absolute value of, the intensity of the current changes with the sign of the, external difference of potential. In every case,  for considerable, potential differences,  the effect of the electromotive, force of contact is negligible,  and the intensity of, the current is therefore the same whatever be the direction, of the field between the plates., The investigation of the conductivity of air and other, gases subjected to the action of Becquerel rays has been, undertaken by several physicists. A very complete research, upon the subject has been published by Mr., Rutherford., The laws of the conductivity produced in gases by the, Becquerel rays are the same as those found for the, Röntgen rays. The mechanics of the phenomenon appear, to be the same in both cases. The theory of ionisation of, the gases by the action of the Röntgen or Becquerel rays, agrees well with the observed facts. This theory will not, be put forward here. I will merely record the results to, which they point:—, Firstly,  the number of ions produced per second in the, gas is considered proportional to the energy of radiation, absorbed by the gas., Secondly,  in order to obtain the limiting current relatively, to a given radiation,  it is necessary,  on the one, hand,  to cause complete absorption of this radiation by the, gas by employing a sufficient mass of it; on the other, hand,  it is necessary for the production of the current to, use all the ions generated by establishing an electric field of, such strength that the number of the ions which recombine, may be a negligible fraction of the total number of ions, produced in the same time,  most of which are carried by, the current to the electrodes. The strength of the electric, field necessary to give this result is proportional to the, amount of ionisation., According to the recent researches of Mr. Townsend,  the, 11, phenomenon is more complex when the pressure of the gas, is low. At first the current appears to approach to a, constant limiting value with increasing difference of, potential; but after a certain point has been reached,  the, current begins again to increase with the field,  and with, very great rapidity. Mr. Townsend ascribes this increase, to a new ionisation produced by the ions themselves when, under the action of the electric field,  they acquire a velocity, such that a molecule of gas encountering one of them becomes, broken down into its constituent ions. A strong, electric field and a low pressure are favourable to the production, of this ionisation by ions already present,  and,  as, soon as the action is set up,  the intensity of the current increases, uniformly with the field between the plates. The, limiting current could,  therefore,  only be obtained under, conditions of ionisation of which the intensity does not, exceed a certain value,  and in such a manner that saturation, corresponds to fields in which,  from multiplicity of ions, ionisation can no longer take place. This condition has, occurred in my experiments., The order of magnitude of the saturation currents, obtained with uranium compounds is 10, –11, ampères for a, condenser in which the plates have a diameter of 8 c.m., and are at a distance of 3 c.m. Thorium compounds give, rise to currents of the same order of magnitude,  and the, activity of the oxides of uranium and thorium is very, similar., Radio-activity of the Compounds of Uranium and Thorium., The following are the figures I obtained with different, uranium compounds. I have represented the intensity of, the current in ampères by the letter, i, :—, i, × 10, 11, ., Metallic uranium (containing a little carbon), 2·3, Black oxide of uranium,  U, 2, O, 5, 2·6, Green oxide of uranium,  U, 3, O, 4, 1·8, Hydrated uranic acid, 0·6, Uranate of sodium, 1·2, Uranate of potassium, 1·2, Uranate of ammonium, 1·3, Uranium sulphate, 0·7, Sulphate of uranium and potassium, 0·7, Nitrate of uranium, 0·7, Phosphate of copper and uranium, 0·9, Oxysulphide of uranium, 1·2, 12, The thickness of the layer of the uranium compound used, has little effect,  provided that the layer is uniform. The, following illustrate this point:—, Thickness of layer., M.m., i, × 10, 11, ., Uranium oxide, 0·5, 2·7, Uranium oxide, 3·0, 3·0, Ammonium uranate, 0·5, 1·3, Ammonium uranate, 3·0, 1·4, It may be concluded from this that the absorption of, uranium rays by the substance which generates them is, very great,  since the rays proceeding from deep layers, produce no significant effect., The figures I obtained with thorium compounds enable, me to state:—, Firstly,  that the thickness of the layer used has considerable, effect,  especially in the case of the oxide., Secondly,  that the action is only regular if a sufficiently, thin layer is used (, e.g.,  0·25 m.m.). On the contrary,  when, a thick layer of the substance is used (6 m.m.),  the figures, obtained vary between two extreme limits,  especially in the, case of the oxide:—, Thickness of layer., M.m., i, × 10, 11, ., Thorium oxide, 0·25, 2·2, Thorium oxide, 0·5, 2·5, Thorium oxide, 2·5, 4·7, Thorium oxide, 3·0, 5·5 (mean), Thorium oxide, 6·0, 5·5 (mean), Thorium sulphate, 0·25, 0·8 (mean), There is here some cause of irregularities which do not, exist in the case of the uranium compounds. The figures, obtained for a layer of oxide 6 m.m. thick varied between, 3·7 and 7·3., The experiments that I made on the absorption of, uranium and thorium rays showed that those of thorium, are more penetrating than those of uranium,  and that the, rays emitted by the oxide of thorium in a thick layer are, more penetrating than those emitted by a thin layer of the, same. The following figures (p., 13, ) give the fraction of the, radiation transmitted by a sheet of aluminium 0·01 thick., With the uranium compounds,  the absorption is the, same whatever be the compound used,  which leads to the, conclusion that the rays emitted by the different compounds, are of the same nature., 13, Radio-active substance., Fraction of radiation transmitted by the sheet., Uranium, 0·18, Uranium oxide,  U, 2, O, 5, 0·20, Uranate of ammonium, 0·20, Phosphate of uranium and copper, 0·21, Thorium oxide of thickness 0·25 m.m., 0·38, Thorium oxide of thickness 0·5  m.m., 0·47, Thorium oxide of thickness 3·0  m.m., 0·70, Thorium oxide of thickness 0·60 m.m., 0·70, Thorium sulphate           0·25 m.m., 0·38, The characteristics of the thorium radiation have formed, the subject of very complete publications. Mr. Owens has, demonstrated that a uniform current is only obtained after, some time has elapsed,  with an enclosed apparatus,  and, that the intensity of the current is greatly reduced under, the influence of a current of air (which does not occur with, the compounds of uranium). Mr. Rutherford has made, similar experiments,  and has explained them by the proposition, that thorium and its compounds produce,  besides, the Becquerel rays,  another, emanation,  composed of, extremely minute particles,  which remain radio-active for, some time after their emission,  and are capable of being, swept along by a current of air., The characteristics of the thorium radiation,  which have, reference to the thickness of the layer employed and to the, action of air currents,  have an intimate connection with the, phenomenon of the, radio-activity induced,  and of its propagation, from place to place, . This phenomenon was observed, for the first time with radium,  and will be described later., The radio-activity of thorium and uranium compounds, appears as an, atomic property, . M. Becquerel has already, observed that all uranium compounds are active,  and had, concluded that their activity was due to the presence of the, element uranium; he also demonstrated that uranium, was more active than its salts. I have investigated,  from, this point of view,  the compounds of thorium and uranium, and have taken a great many measurements of their, activity under different conditions. The result of all these, determinations shows the radio-activity of these substances, to be decidedly an atomic property. It seems to depend, upon the presence of atoms of the two elements in question, and is not influenced by any change of physical state or, chemical decomposition. The chemical combinations and, mixtures containing uranium or thorium are active in proportion, 14, to the amount of the metal contained,  all inactive, material acting as inert bodies and absorbing the radiation., Is Atomic Radio-activity a general Phenomenon?, As I have said above,  I made experiments to discover, whether substances other than compounds of uranium and, thorium were radio-active. I undertook this research with, the idea that it was scarcely probable that radio-activity, considered as an atomic property,  should belong to a, certain kind of matter to the exclusion of all other. The, determinations I made permit me to say that,  for chemical, elements actually considered as such,  including the rarest, and most hypothetical,  the compounds I investigated were, always at least 100 times less active in my apparatus than, metallic uranium., The following is a summary of the substances experimented, upon,  either as the element or in combination:—, 1. All the metals or non-metals easily procurable,  and, some,  more rare,  pure products obtained from the collection, of M. Etard,  at the Ecole de Physique et de Chimie, Industrielles de la Ville de Paris., 2. The following rare bodies:—Gallium,  germanium, neodymium,  praseodymium,  niobium,  scandium,  gadolinium, erbium,  samarium,  and rubidium (specimens lent by, M. Demarçay),  yttrium,  ytterbium (lent by M. Urbain)., 3. A large number of rocks and minerals., Within the limits of sensitiveness of any apparatus,  I, found no simple substance,  other than uranium and, thorium,  possessing atomic radio-activity. It will be, suitable to add a few words here concerning phosphorus., White moist phosphorus,  placed between the plates of the, condenser,  causes the air between the plates to conduct., However,  I do not consider this body radio-active in the, same manner as thorium and uranium. For,  under these, conditions,  phosphorus becomes oxidised and emits, luminous rays,  whilst uranium and thorium compounds are, radio-active without showing any chemical change which can, be detected by any known means. Further,  phosphorus is, not active in the red variety,  nor in a state of combination., In a recent work,  M. Bloch has demonstrated that phosphorus, undergoing oxidation in air,  gives rise to slightly, motile ions,  which make the air conduct,  and cause condensation, of aqueous vapour., Uranium and thorium are elements which possess the, highest atomic weights (240 and 232); they occur frequently, in the same minerals., 15, Radio-active Minerals., I have examined many minerals in my apparatus; certain, of them gave evidence of radio-activity, e.g.,  pitchblende, thorite,  orangite,  fergusonite,  cleveite,  chalcolite,  autunite, monazite,  &c. The following is a table giving in ampères, the intensity, i,  of the current obtained with metallic, uranium and with different minerals:—, i, × 10, 11, ., Uranium, 2·3, Pitchblende from Johanngeorgenstadt, 8·3, Pitchblende from Joachimsthal, 7·0, Pitchblende from Pzibran, 6·5, Pitchblende from Cornwallis, 1·6, Cleveite, 1·4, Chalcolite, 5·2, Autunite, 2·7, Various thorites, 0·1, 0·3, 0·7, 1·3, 1·4, Orangite, 2·0, Monazite, 0·5, Xenotime, 0·03, Æschynite, 0·7, Fergusonite (two samples), 0·4, 0·1, Samarskite, 1·1, Niobite (two samples), 0·1, 0·3, Tantalite, 0·02, Carnotite, 6·2, The current obtained with orangite (native oxide of, thorium) varied greatly with the thickness of the layer. By, increasing this thickness from 0·25 m.m. to 6 m.m. the, current increased from 1·8 to 2·3., All the minerals which showed radio-activity contained, uranium or thorium: their activity is therefore not surprising, but the intensity of the action in certain cases is, unexpected. Thus pitchblendes (ores of uranium oxide) are, found which are four times as active as metallic uranium., Chalcolite (double phosphate of copper and uranium) is, twice as active as uranium. Autunite (phosphate of, uranium and calcium) is as active as uranium. These, facts do not accord with previous conclusions,  according, 16, to which no mineral should be so active as thorium or, uranium., To throw light on this point,  I prepared artificial, chalcolite by the process of Debray,  starting with the pure, products. The process consists in mixing a solution of, uranium nitrate with a solution of copper phosphate in, phosphoric acid and warming to 50° or 60°. After some, time,  crystals of chalcolite appear in the liquid., Chalcolite thus obtained possesses a perfectly normal, activity,  given by its composition; it is two and a-half times, less active than uranium., It therefore appeared probable that if pitchblende, chalcolite,  and autunite possess so great a degree of, activity,  these substances contain a small quantity of a, strongly radio-active body,  differing from uranium and, thorium and the simple bodies actually known. I thought, that if this were indeed the case,  I might hope to extract, this substance from the ore by the ordinary methods of, chemical analysis., CHAPTER II., Method of Research., The results of the investigation of radio-active minerals, announced in the preceding chapter,  led M. Curie and myself, to endeavour to extract a new radio-active body from pitchblende., Our method of procedure could only be based on, radio-activity,  as we know of no other property of the hypothetical, substance. The following is the method pursued, for a research based on radio-activity:—The radio-activity, of a compound is determined,  and a chemical decomposition, of this compound is effected; the radio-activity of all the, products obtained is determined,  having regard to the proportion, in which the radio-active substance is distributed, among them. In this way,  an indication is obtained,  which, may to a certain extent be compared to that which spectrum, analysis furnishes. In order to obtain comparable figures, the activity of the substances must be determined in the, solid form well dried., Polonium,  Radium,  Actinium., The analysis of pitchblende with the help of the method, just explained,  led us to the discovery in this mineral of two, strongly radio-active substances,  chemically dissimilar:—Polonium, discovered by ourselves,  and radium,  which we, discovered in conjunction with M. Bémont., 17, Polonium, from the analytical point of view,  is analogous, to bismuth,  and separates out with the latter. By one of, the following methods of fractionating,  bismuth products, are obtained increasingly rich in polonium:—, 1. Sublimation of the sulphides, in vacuo, ; the active sulphide, is much more volatile than bismuth sulphide., 2. Precipitation of solutions of the nitrate by water; the, precipitate of the basic nitrate is much more active than the, salt which remains in solution., 3. Precipitation by sulphuretted hydrogen of a hydrochloric, acid solution,  strongly acid; the precipitated sulphides, are considerably more active than the salt which, remains in solution., Radium, is a substance which accompanies the barium, obtained from pitchblende; it resembles barium in its reactions, and is separated from it by difference of solubility, of the chlorides in water,  in dilute alcohol,  or in water, acidified with hydrochloric acid. We effect the separation, of the chlorides of barium and radium by subjecting the mixture, to fractional crystallisation,  radium chloride being less, soluble than that of barium., A third strongly radio-active body has been identified in, pitchblende by M. Debierne,  who gave it the name of, actinium, . Actinium accompanies certain members of the, iron group contained in pitchblende; it appears in particular, allied to thorium,  from which it has not yet been found, possible to separate it. The extraction of actinium from, pitchblende is a very difficult operation,  the separations, being as a rule incomplete., All three of the new radio-active bodies occur in quite, infinitesimal amount in pitchblende. In order to obtain, them in a more concentrated condition,  we were obliged to, treat several tons of residue of the ore of uranium. The, rough treatment was carried out in the factory; and this, was followed by processes of purification and concentration., We thus succeeded in extracting from thousands of kilogrms., of crude material a few decigrammes of products which, were exceedingly active as compared with the ore from which, they were obtained. It is obvious that this process is long, arduous,  and costly., Other new radio-active bodies have been notified since the, termination of our work. M. Giesel,  on the one hand,  and, MM. Hoffmann and Strauss on the other,  have announced, the probable existence of a radio-active body similar to lead, in its chemical properties. At present only a few samples, of this substance have been obtained., 18, Radium is,  so far,  the only member of the new radio-active, substances that has been isolated as the pure salt., Spectrum of Radium., It was of the first importance to check,  by all possible, means,  the hypothesis,  underlying this work,  of new radio-active, elements. In the case of radium,  spectrum analysis, was the means of confirming this hypothesis., M. Demarçay undertook the examination of the new radio-active, bodies by the searching methods which he employs in, the study of photographic spark spectra., The assistance of so competent a scientist was of the, greatest value to us,  and we are deeply grateful to him for, having consented to take up this work. The results of the, spectrum analysis brought conviction to us when we were, still in doubt as to the interpretation of the results of our, research., The first specimens of fairly active barium chloride containing, radium,  examined by M. Demarçay,  exhibited, together with the barium lines a new line of considerable intensity, and of wave-length λ = 381·47 µµ in the ultra-violet., With the more active products prepared subsequently,  Demarçay, saw the line 381·47 µµ more distinctly; at the same, time other new lines appeared,  and the intensity of the new, lines was comparable with that of the barium lines. A further, concentration furnished a product for which the new spectrum, predominated,  and the three strongest barium lines, alone visible,  merely indicated the presence of this metal as, an impurity. This product may be looked upon as nearly, pure radium chloride. Finally,  by further purification,  I, obtained an exceedingly pure chloride,  in the spectrum of, which the two chief barium lines were scarcely visible., The following is a list,  according to Demarçay,  of the, principal radium lines for the portion of the spectrum included, between λ = 500·0 and λ = 350·0 µµ. The intensity, of each line is represented by a figure,  the strongest being, marked 16:—, λ., Intensity., 482·63, 10, 472·69, 5, 469·98, 3, 469·21, 7, 468·30, 14, 464·19, 4, 460·03, 3, 453·35, 9, 443·61, 8, 434·06, 12, 381·47, 16, 364·96, 12, All the lines are clear and narrow,  the three lines 381·47, 19, 468·30,  434·06 are strong,  and equal the most intense of, those actually known. Two well-marked misty bands are, also visible in the spectrum. The first,  which is symmetrical, extends from 463·10 to 462·19,  with a maximum, at 462·75. The second,  which is stronger,  fades towards, the ultra-violet; it begins,  sharply defined,  at 446·37,  and, passes through a maximum at 445·52; the region of the, maximum extends as far as 445·34,  then a nebulous band, gradually fading,  extends about as far as 439., In the least refrangible part,  not photographed in the, spark spectrum,  the only significant line is 566·5 (approx.), much more feeble,  however,  than 482·63., The general aspect of the spectrum is that of the metals, of the alkaline earths; these metals are known to have, well-marked line spectra with certain nebulous bands., According to Demarçay,  the position of radium may, be among the bodies possessing the most sensitive spectrum, reaction. I also have concluded from the work of concentration, that in the first specimen examined,  which showed, clearly the line 3814·7,  the proportion of radium must have, been very small (perhaps about 0·02 per cent). Nevertheless, an activity fifty times as great as that of metallic uranium, is required in order to distinguish clearly the principal, radium line in the spectra photographed. With a sensitive, electrometer the radio-activity of a substance only 1/100, of that of metallic uranium can be detected. It is clear, that,  in order to detect the presence of radium,  the property, of radio-activity is several thousand times more sensitive, than the spectrum reaction., Bismuth containing polonium and thorium containing, actinium,  both very active,  examined by Demarçay,  have so, far each only yielded bismuth and thorium lines., In a recent publication,  M. Giesel,  who is occupied in, preparing radium,  states that radium bromide gives a, carmine flame colouration. The flame spectrum of radium, contains two beautiful red bands,  one line in the blue-green, and two faint lines in the violet., Extraction of the New Radio-active Substances., The first stage of the operation consists in extracting, barium with radium from the ores of uranium,  also bismuth, with polonium and the rare earths containing actinium, from the same. These three primary products having been, obtained,  the next step is in each case to endeavour to, isolate the new radio-active body. This second part of the, treatment consists of a process of fractionation. The, 20, difficulty of finding a very perfect means of separating, closely allied elements is well known; methods of fractionation, are therefore quite suitable. Besides this,  when a, mere trace of one element is mixed with another element, no method of complete separation could be applied to the, mixture,  even allowing that such a method was known; in, fact,  one would run the risk of losing the trace of the, material to be separated., The particular object of my work has been the isolation, of radium and polonium. After working for several years, I have so far only succeeded in obtaining the former., Pitchblende is an expensive ore,  and we have given up, the treatment of it in large quantities. In Europe the, extraction of this ore is carried out in the mine of, Joachimsthal,  in Bohemia. The crushed ore is roasted with, carbonate of soda,  and the resulting material washed,  first, with warm water and then with dilute sulphuric acid. The, solution contains the uranium,  which gives pitchblende its, value. The insoluble residue is rejected. This residue, contains radio-active substances; its activity is four and a-half, times that of metallic uranium. The Austrian Government, to whom the mine belongs,  presented us with a ton, of this residue for our research,  and authorised the mine to, give us several tons more of the material., It was not very easy to apply the methods of the, laboratory to the preliminary treatment of the residue in, the factory. M. Debierne investigated this question,  and, organised the treatment in the factory. The most important, point of his method is the conversion of the sulphates, into carbonate by boiling the material with a, concentrated solution of sodium carbonate. This method, avoids the necessity of fusing with sodium carbonate., The residue chiefly contains the sulphates of lead and, calcium,  silica,  alumina,  and iron oxide. In addition, nearly all the metals are found in greater or smaller, amount (copper,  bismuth,  zinc,  cobalt,  manganese,  nickel, vanadium,  antimony,  thallium,  rare earths,  niobium, tantalum,  arsenic,  barium,  &c.). Radium is found in this, mixture as sulphate,  and is the least soluble sulphate in it., In order to dissolve it,  it is necessary to remove the, sulphuric acid as far as possible. To do this,  the residue is, first treated with a boiling concentrated soda solution., The sulphuric acid combined with the lead,  aluminium, and calcium passes,  for the most part,  into solution as sulphate, of sodium,  which is removed by repeatedly washing, with water. The alkaline solution removes at the same, 21, time lead,  silicon,  and aluminium. The insoluble portion, is attacked by ordinary hydrochloric acid. This operation, completely disintegrates the material,  and dissolves most, of it. Polonium and actinium may be obtained from this, solution; the former is precipitated by sulphuretted, hydrogen,  the latter is found in the hydrates precipitated by, ammonia in the solution separated from the sulphides and, oxidised. Radium remains in the insoluble portion. This, portion is washed with water,  and then treated with a, boiling concentrated solution of carbonate of soda. This, operation completes the transformation of the sulphates of, barium and radium into carbonates. The material is  then, thoroughly washed with water,  and then treated with dilute, hydrochloric acid,  quite free from sulphuric acid. The, solution contains radium as well as polonium and actinium., It is filtered and precipitated with sulphuric acid. In this, way the crude sulphates of barium containing radium and, calcium,  of lead,  and of iron,  and of a trace of actinium are, obtained. The solution still contains a little actinium and, polonium,  which may be separated out as in the case of the, first hydrochloric acid solution., From one ton of residue 10 to 20 kilogrms. of crude sulphates, are obtained,  the activity of which is from thirty to, sixty times as great as that of metallic uranium. They, must now be purified. For this purpose they are boiled, with sodium carbonate and transformed into the chlorides., The solution is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen,  which, gives a small quantity of active sulphides containing, polonium. The solution is filtered,  oxidised by means of, chlorine,  and precipitated with pure ammonia. The precipitated, hydrates and oxides are very active,  and the, activity is due to actinium. The filtered solution is precipitated, with sodium carbonate. The precipitated carbonates, of the alkaline earths are washed and converted, into chlorides. These chlorides are evaporated to dryness, and washed with pure concentrated hydrochloric acid., Calcium chloride dissolves almost entirely,  whilst the, chloride of barium and radium remains insoluble. Thus, from one ton of the original material about 8 kilogrms. of, barium and radium chloride are obtained,  of which the, activity is about sixty times that of metallic uranium. The, chloride is now ready for fractionation., Polonium., As I said above,  by passing sulphuretted hydrogen, through the various hydrochloric acid solutions obtained, 22, during the course of the process,  active sulphides are precipitated, of which the activity is due to polonium. These, sulphides chiefly contain bismuth,  a little copper and lead;, the latter metal occurs in relatively small amount,  because, it has been to a great extent removed by the soda solution, and because its chloride is only slightly soluble. Antimony, and arsenic are found among the oxides only in the, minutest quantity,  their oxides having been dissolved by, the soda. In order to obtain the very active sulphides,  the, following process was employed:—The solutions made, strongly acid with hydrochloric acid were precipitated with, sulphuretted hydrogen; the sulphides thus precipitated are, very active,  and are employed for the preparation of, polonium; there remain in the solution substances not, completely precipitated in presence of excess of hydrochloric, acid (bismuth,  lead,  antimony). To complete the, precipitation,  the solution is diluted with water,  and, treated again with sulphuretted hydrogen,  which gives a, second precipitate of sulphides,  much less active than the, first,  and which have generally been rejected. For the, further purification of the sulphides,  they are washed with, ammonium sulphide,  which removes the last remaining, traces of antimony and arsenic. They are then washed, with water and ammonium nitrate,  and treated with dilute, nitric acid. Complete solution never occurs; there is, always an insoluble residue,  more or less considerable, which can be treated afresh if it is judged expedient. The, solution is reduced to a small volume and precipitated, either by ammonia or by excess of water. In both cases, the lead and the copper remain in solution; in the second, case,  a little bismuth,  scarcely active at all,  remains also in, solution., The precipitate of oxides or basic nitrates is subjected to, fractionation in the following manner:—The precipitate is, dissolved in nitric acid,  and water is added to the solution, until a sufficient quantity of precipitate is formed; it must, be borne in mind that sometimes the precipitate does not, at once appear. The precipitate is separated from the, supernatant liquid,  and re-dissolved in nitric acid,  after, which both the liquids thus obtained are re-precipitated, with water,  and treated as before. The different fractions, are combined according to their activity,  and concentration, is carried out as far as possible. In this way is obtained a, very small quantity of a substance of which the activity is, very high,  but which,  nevertheless,  has so far only shown, bismuth lines in the spectroscope., 23, There is,  unfortunately,  little chance of obtaining the, isolation of polonium by this means. The method of, fractionation just described presents many difficulties,  and, the case is similar with other wet processes of fractionation., Whatever be the method employed,  compounds are, readily formed which are absolutely insoluble in dilute or, concentrated acids. These compounds can only be re-dissolved, by reducing them to the metallic state, e.g.,  by, fusion with potassium cyanide. Considering the number, of operations necessary,  this circumstance constitutes an, enormous difficulty in the progress of the fractionation., This obstacle is the greater because polonium,  once extracted, from the pitchblende,  diminishes in activity. This, diminution of activity is slow,  for a specimen of bismuth, nitrate containing polonium only lost half its activity in, eleven months., No such difficulty occurs with radium. The radio-activity, remains throughout an accurate gauge of the concentration;, the concentration itself presents no difficulty, and the progress of the work from the start can be constantly, checked by spectral analysis., When the phenomena of induced radio-activity,  which, will be discussed later on,  were made known,  it seemed, obvious that polonium,  which only shows the bismuth, lines and whose activity diminishes with time,  was not a, new element,  but bismuth made active by the vicinity of, radium in the pitchblende. I am not sure that this opinion, is correct. In the course of my prolonged work on, polonium,  I have noted chemical effects,  which I have, never observed either with ordinary bismuth or with, bismuth made active by radium. These chemical effects, are,  in the first place,  the extremely ready formation of, insoluble compounds,  of which I have spoken above, (especially basic nitrates),  and,  in the second place,  the, colour and appearance of the precipitates obtained by, adding water to the nitric acid solution of bismuth containing, polonium. These precipitates are sometimes white, but more generally of a more or less vivid yellow,  verging, on red., The absence of lines other than those of bismuth does, not necessarily prove that the substance only contains, bismuth,  because bodies exist whose spectrum reaction is, scarcely visible., It would be necessary to prepare a small quantity of, bismuth containing polonium in as concentrated a condition, as possible,  and to examine it chemically,  in the, 24, first place determining the atomic weight of the metal. It, has not yet been possible to carry out this research on, account of the difficulties of a chemical nature already, mentioned., If polonium were proved to be a new element,  it would be, no less true that it cannot exist indefinitely in a strongly, radio-active condition,  at least when extracted from the, ore. There are therefore two aspects of the question:—First, whether the activity of polonium is entirely induced, by the proximity of substances themselves radio-active,  in, which case polonium would possess the faculty of acquiring, atomic activity permanently,  a faculty which does not, appear to belong to any substance whatever; second, whether the activity of polonium is an inherent property, which is spontaneously destroyed under certain conditions, and persists under certain other conditions,  such as those, which exist in the ore. The phenomenon of atomic activity, induced by contact is still so little understood,  that we lack, the ground on which to formulate any opinion on the, matter., (, Note., —A work has recently appeared on polonium by, M. Marckwald. He plunges a small rod of pure bismuth, into a hydrochloric acid solution of the bismuth extracted, from the pitchblende residue. After some time the rod, becomes coated with a very active deposit,  and the solution, now contains only inactive bismuth. M. Marckwald also, obtains a very active deposit by adding tin chloride to a, hydrochloric acid solution of radio-active bismuth. From, this he concludes that the active element is allied to, tellurium,  and gives it the name of, radiotellurium, . This, active substance of M. Marckwald seems identical with, polonium,  from its behaviour,  and from the easily absorbed, rays it emits. The choice of a new name for this substance, is futile in the present state of the question)., Preparation of the Pure Chloride of Radium., The method by which I extracted pure radium chloride, from barium chloride containing radium consists in first, subjecting the mixture of the chlorides to fractional crystallisation, in pure water,  then in water to which hydrochloric, acid has been added. The difference in solubility of the, two chlorides is thus made use of,  that of radium being less, soluble than that of barium., At the beginning of the fractionation,  pure distilled water, is used. The chloride is dissolved,  and the solution raised, to boiling-point,  and allowed to crystallise by cooling in a, 25, covered capsule. Beautiful crystals form at the bottom, and the supernatant,  saturated solution is easily decanted., If part of this solution be evaporated to dryness,  the, chloride obtained is found to be about five times less active, than that which has crystallised out. The chloride is thus, divided into two portions,  A and B—portion A being more, active than portion B. The operation is now repeated with, each of the chlorides A and B,  and in each case two new, portions are obtained. When the crystallisation is finished, the less active fraction of chloride A is added to the more, active fraction of chloride B,  these two having approximately, the same activity. Thus there are now three, portions to undergo afresh the same treatment., The number of portions is not allowed to increase indefinitely., The activity of the most soluble portion, diminishes as the number increases. When its activity, becomes inconsiderable,  it is withdrawn from the fractionation., When the desired number of fractions has been, obtained,  fractionation of the least soluble portion is stopped, (the richest in radium),  and it is withdrawn from the, remainder., A fixed number of fractions is used in the process. After, each series of operations,  the saturated solution arising, from one fraction is added to the crystals arising from the, following fraction; but if after one of the series the most, soluble fraction has been withdrawn,  then,  after the following, series,  a new fraction is made from the most soluble, portion,  and the crystals of the most active portion are, withdrawn. By the successive alteration of these two, processes,  an extremely regular system of fractionation is, obtained,  in which the number of fractions and the activity, of each remains constant,  each being about five times as, active as the subsequent one,  and in which,  on the one, hand,  an almost inactive product is removed,  whilst,  on the, other,  is obtained a chloride rich in radium. The amount, of material contained in these fractions gradually diminishes, becoming less as the activity increases., At first six fractions were used,  and the activity of the, chloride obtained at the end was only 0·1 that of uranium., When most of the inactive matter has been removed,  and, the fractions have become small,  one fraction is removed, from the one end,  and another is added to the other end, consisting of the active chloride previously removed. A, chloride richer in radium than the preceding is thus, obtained. This system is continued until the crystals obtained, are pure radium chloride. If the fractionation has, 26, been thoroughly carried out,  scarcely any trace of the intermediate, products remain., At an advanced stage of the fractionation,  when the, quantity of material in each fraction is small,  the separation, by crystallisation is less efficacious,  the cooling being too, rapid and the volume of the solution to be decanted too, small. It is then advisable to add water containing a, known quantity of hydrochloric acid; this quantity may be, increased as the fractionation proceeds., The advantage gained thus consists in increasing the, quantity of the solution,  the solubility of the chlorides being, less in water acidified with hydrochloric acid than in pure, water. By using water containing much acid,  excellent, separations are effected,  and it is only necessary to work, with three or four fractions., The crystals,  which form in very acid solution,  are, elongated needles,  those of barium chloride having exactly, the same appearance as those of radium chloride. Both, show double refraction. Crystals of barium chloride containing, radium are colourless,  but when the proportion of, radium becomes greater,  they have a yellow colouration, after some hours,  verging on orange,  and sometimes a, beautiful pink. This colour disappears in solution. Crystals, of pure radium chloride are not coloured,  so that the, colouration appears to be due to the mixture of radium and, barium. The maximum colouration is obtained for a, certain degree of radium present,  and this fact serves to, check the progress of the fractionation., I have sometimes noticed the formation of a deposit, composed of crystals of which one part remained uncoloured, whilst the other was coloured,  and it seems, possible that the colourless crystals might be sorted out., The fractional precipitation of an aqueous solution of, barium chloride by alcohol also leads to the isolation of, radium chloride,  which is the first to precipitate. This, method,  which I first employed,  was finally abandoned, for the one just described,  which proceeds with more, regularity. I have,  however,  occasionally made use of, precipitation by alcohol to purify radium chloride which, contains traces of barium chloride. The latter remains in, the slightly aqueous alcoholic solution,  and can thus be, removed., M. Giesel,  who,  since the publication of our first researches, has been preparing radio-active bodies,  recommends, the separation of barium and radium by fractional, crystallisation in water from a mixture of the bromides. I, 27, can testify that this method is advantageous,  especially in, the first stages of the fractionation., Determination of the Atomic Weight of Radium., In the course of my work I determined at intervals the, atomic weight of the metal contained in specimens of, barium chloride containing radium. With each newly, obtained product I carried the concentration as far as, possible,  so as to have from 0·1 grm. to 0·5 grm. of, material containing most of the activity of the mixture., From this small quantity I precipitated with alcohol or, with hydrochloric acid some milligrams of chloride for, spectral analysis. Thanks to his excellent method, Demarçay only required this small quantity of material to, obtain the photograph of the spark spectrum. I made an, atomic weight determination with the product remaining., I employed the classic method of weighing as silver, chloride the chlorine contained in a known weight of the, anhydrous chloride. As control experiment,  I determined, the atomic weight of barium by the same method,  under, the same conditions,  and with the same quantity of material, first 0·5 grm. and then 0·1 grm. The figures obtained were, always between 137 and 138. I thus saw that the method, gives satisfactory results,  even with a very small quantity of, material., The first two determinations were made with chlorides, of which one was 230 times and the other 600 times as, active as uranium. These two experiments gave the same, figure as the experiment with the pure barium chloride., There was therefore no hope of finding a difference except, by using a much more active product. The following, experiment was made with a chloride,  the activity of which, was about 3500 times as great as that of uranium; and, this experiment enabled me,  for the first time,  to observe a, small but distinct difference; I found,  as the mean atomic, weight of the metal contained in this chloride,  the number, 140,  which showed that the atomic weight of radium must, be higher than that of barium. By using more and more, active products,  and obtaining spectra of radium of increasing, intensity,  I found that the figures obtained rose in, proportion,  as is seen in the following table (p., 28, )., The figures of column A must only be looked upon as a, rough estimate. The calculation of the activity of strongly, radio-active bodies is difficult,  for many reasons which will, be discussed later., 28, A., M., 3500, 140, Spectrum of radium faint., 4700, 141, 7500, 145·8, Spectrum of radium strong,  but that of barium predominating., Order of Magnitude,   10, 6, ..., 173·8, The two spectra of almost equal intensity., 225, Only a trace of barium present., A represents the activity of the chloride,  that of uranium, being unity; M the atomic weight found., At the termination of the processes described above,  I, obtained,  in March,  1902,  0·12 grm. of radium chloride,  of, which Demarçay made the spectral analysis. This, radium chloride,  in the opinion of Demarçay,  was fairly, pure; its spectrum,  however,  showed the three principal, barium lines with considerable intensity. I made four, successive estimations of the chloride,  the results of which, as follows:—, Anhydrous radium chloride., Silver chloride., M., I., 0·1150, 0·1130, 220·7, II., 0·1140, 0·1119, 223·0, III., 0·11135, 0·1086, 222·8, IV., 0·10925, 0·10645, 223·1, I then re-purified this chloride,  and obtained a much, purer substance,  in the spectrum of which the two strongest, barium lines were very faint. Given the sensitiveness of, the spectrum reaction of barium,  Demarçay estimated that, the purified chloride contained only the merest traces of, barium,  incapable of influencing the atomic weight to an, appreciable extent. I made three determinations with this, perfectly pure radium chloride. The results were as, follows:—, Anhydrous radium chloride., Silver chloride., M., I., 0·09192, 0·08890, 225·3, II., 0·08936, 0·08627, 225·8, III., 0·08839, 0·08589, 224·0, The mean of these numbers is 225. They were calculated, in the same way as the preceding ones by considering, radium as a bivalent element,  the chloride having, the formula RaCl, 2,  and taking for silver and chlorine the, values Ag = 107·8,  Cl = 35·4., Hence the atomic weight of radium is Ra = 225., The weighings were made with a Curie aperiodic, balance,  perfectly regulated,  accurate to the twentieth of a, 29, milligrm. This direct reading balance permits of very, rapid weighing,  a condition which is essential in the case, of the anhydrous chlorides of radium and barium,  which, gradually absorb moisture,  in spite of the presence of desiccating, substances in the balance. The bodies to be, weighed were placed in a platinum crucible; this crucible, had been long in use,  and its weight did not vary the tenth, part of a milligrm. during the course of one operation., The hydrated chloride obtained by crystallisation was, placed in the crucible and heated till converted into the, anhydrous chloride. When the chloride has been kept for, several hours at 100° its weight becomes constant,  and does, not change even if the temperature is raised to 200°. The, anhydrous chloride thus obtained constitutes,  therefore,  a, perfectly definite body., The following is a series of determinations on this point., The chloride (100 m.g.) is dried in the oven at 55°,  and, placed in a desiccator over anhydrous phosphoric acid; it, then gradually loses weight,  which proves that it still, contains moisture; in the course of twelve hours the loss, was 3 m.g. The chloride is replaced in the stove,  and the, temperature raised to 100°. During this process,  the, chloride lost 6·3 m.g. in weight. After being left three, hours fifteen minutes in the oven,  it lost 2·5 m.g. more., The temperature was maintained for forty-five minutes between, 100° and 120°,  which caused a loss of weight of 0·1, m.g. Then after being kept for thirty minutes at 125°,  the, chloride showed no diminution in weight. Then,  however, after thirty minutes at 150°,  it lost 0·1 m.g. Finally,  after, being heated for four hours at 200°,  it lost 0·15 m.g., During these operations the crucible varied from 0·05 m.g., After each determination of the atomic weight,  the, radium was converted into the chloride in the following, manner:—To the solution containing the weighed radium, nitrate and excess of silver nitrate was added pure hydrochloric, acid; the silver chloride was filtered off; the solution, was evaporated to dryness several times with excess of, pure hydrochloric acid. In this way the nitric acid is, entirely removed., The precipitated silver chloride was always radio-active, and phosphorescent. In determining the amount of silver, contained in it,  I satisfied myself that no ponderable, amount of radium had been carried down with it out of the, solution. The method I pursued was to reduce the silver, chloride precipitated in the crucible by hydrogen generated, from dilute hydrochloric acid and zinc; after washing,  the, 30, crucible was weighed with the metallic silver contained, in it., I made another experiment which showed that the, weight of radium chloride regenerated was the same as that, before beginning the operation., These verifications are not so reliable as direct experiments;, but they serve to indicate the absence of any, significant error., From its chemical properties,  radium is an element of, the group of alkaline earths,  being the member next above, barium., From its atomic weight also,  radium takes its place in, Mendeleeff’s table after barium with the alkaline earth, metals,  in the row which already contains uranium and, thorium., Characteristics of the Radium Salts., The salts of radium,  chloride,  nitrate,  carbonate,  and, sulphate,  resemble those of barium,  when freshly prepared, but they gradually become coloured., All the radium salts are luminous in the dark., In their chemical properties,  the salts of radium are, absolutely analogous to the corresponding salts of barium., However,  radium chloride is less soluble than barium, chloride; the solubility of the nitrates in water is approximately, the same., The salts of radium are the source of a spontaneous and, continuous evolution of heat., Fractionation of Ordinary Barium Chloride., We have endeavoured to determine whether commercial, barium chloride contains small quantities of radium, chloride,  which escape detection with the means of, estimation at our command. For this purpose we fractionated, a great quantity of commercial barium chloride,  in, the hope of thus concentrating the trace of radium chloride, if such were present., Fifty kilos. of commercial barium chloride were dissolved, in water; the solution was precipitated by hydrochloric, acid free from sulphuric acid,  which yielded 20 kilos. of the, precipitated chloride. This was dissolved in water and, partially precipitated by hydrochloric acid,  which gave 8·5, kilos. of precipitated chloride. This chloride was fractionated, by the method used for the barium chloride containing, radium; and at the end of the process,  10 grams of, chloride were obtained,  corresponding to the least soluble, part. This chloride showed no radio-activity; it therefore, 31, contained no radium; this substance is,  consequently, absent from the ores of barium., CHAPTER III., Radiation of the New Radio-active Substances., Methods of Investigation of the Radiation., In order to investigate the radiation emitted by radio-active, bodies,  any one of the properties of this radiation, can be utilised. Thus the action of the rays on photographic, plates may serve,  or their property of ionisation, of the air,  which renders it a conductor,  or their capacity, for causing fluorescence of certain bodies. Henceforth,  in, speaking of these different methods of working,  I shall use, the expressions radiographic method,  electrical method, fluoroscopic method., The first two have been used from the beginning in the, study of uranium rays; the fluoroscopic method can only, be applied in the case of the new bodies which are strongly, radio-active,  for the feebly active bodies such as uranium, and thorium produce no appreciable fluorescence. The, electrical method is the only one which serves for exact, determinations of intensity; the other two are specially, adapted for giving qualitative results,  and only furnish, rough approximations. The results obtained with the three, methods just considered are not strictly comparable the one, with the other. The sensitive plate,  the gas which is, ionised,  the fluorescent screen,  are in reality receivers, which absorb the energy of the radiation,  and transform it, into another kind of energy,  chemical energy,  ionic energy, or luminous energy. Each receiver absorbs a fraction of, the radiation,  which depends essentially upon its nature., Later on,  we shall see that the radiation is complex,  that, the fractions of the radiation absorbed by the different, receivers may differ among themselves both quantitatively, and qualitatively. Finally,  it is neither evident,  nor even, probable,  that the energy absorbed is entirely transformed, by the receiver into the form that we wish for observation;, part of this energy may be transformed into heat,  into the, evolution of secondary radiations which may or may not, assist in the production of the observed phenomenon, into chemical action which differs from that under observation, &c.,  and here also the effective action of the, receiver,  with reference to the end we have in view, depends essentially upon the nature of that receiver., Let us compare two radio-active substances,  one containing, 32, radium and the other polonium,  and which show an, equal degree of activity in the condenser of Fig. 1. If each, is covered with a thin leaf of aluminium,  the second appears, considerably less active than the first,  and the same is the, case when they are placed under the same fluorescent, screen,  if the latter is of sufficient thickness,  or is placed, at a certain distance from the two radio-active bodies., Energy of Radiation., Whatever be the method of research employed,  the, energy of radiation of the new radio-active substances is, always found to be considerably greater than that of, uranium and thorium. Thus it is that,  at a short distance, they act instantaneously upon a photographic plate, whereas an exposure of twenty-four hours is necessary, when operating with uranium and thorium. A fluorescent, screen is vividly illuminated by contact with the new radio-active, bodies,  whilst no trace of luminosity is visible with, uranium and thorium. Finally,  the ionising action upon, air is considerably stronger in the ratio of 10, 6, approximately., But it is,  strictly speaking,  not possible to estimate the, total intensity of the radiation,  as in the case of uranium, by the electrical method described at the beginning (Fig., 1). With uranium,  for example,  the radiation is almost, completely absorbed by the layer of air between the plates, and the limiting current is reached at a tension of 100, volts. But the case is different for strongly radio-active, bodies. One portion of the radiation of radium consists of, very penetrating rays,  which penetrate the condenser and, the metallic plates,  and are not utilised in ionising the air, between the plates. Further,  the limiting current cannot, always be obtained for the tensions supplied; for example, with very active polonium the current remains proportional, to the tension between 100 and 500 volts. Therefore the, experimental conditions which give a simple interpretation, are not realised,  and,  consequently,  the numbers obtained, cannot be taken as representing the measurement of the, total radiation; they merely point to a rough approximation., Complex Nature of the Radiation., The researches of various physicists (MM. Becquerel, Meyer and von Schweidler,  Giesel,  Villard,  Rutherford, M. and Mdme. Curie) have proved the complex nature of, the radiation of radio-active bodies. It will be convenient, to specify three kinds of rays,  which I shall denote, 33, according to the notation adopted by Mr. Rutherford,  by the, letters α,  β,  γ., I. The α-rays are very slightly penetrating,  and appear, to constitute the principal part of the radiation. These, rays are characterised by the laws by which they are, absorbed by matter. The magnetic field acts very slightly, upon them,  and they were formerly thought to be quite, unaffected by the action of this field. However,  in a strong, magnetic field,  the α-rays are slightly deflected; the deflection, is caused in the same manner as with cathode rays, but the direction of the deflection is reversed; it is the same, as for the canal rays of the Crookes tubes., II. The β-rays are less absorbable as a whole than the, preceding ones. They are deflected by a magnetic field in, the same manner and direction as cathode rays., III. The γ-rays are penetrating rays,  unaffected by the, magnetic field,  and comparable to Röntgen rays., Fig. 4., Consider the following imaginary experiment:—Some, radium, R,  is placed at the bottom of a small deep cavity, hollowed in a, block of lead, P, (Fig. 4). A sheaf, of rays,  rectilinear, and, slightly expanded, streams, from the receptacle., Let us, suppose that a, strong uniform, magnetic field is, established in, the neighbourhood, of the receptacle, normal, to the plane, of the figure and, directed towards, the back., The three groups of rays,  α,  β,  γ,  will now be separated., Then rather faint γ-rays continue in their straight, path without a trace of deviation. The β-rays are, deflected in the manner of cathode rays,  and describe, circular paths in the plane of the figure. If the receptacle, is placed on a photographic plate, A C,  the portion, B C,  of, the plate which receives the β-rays is acted upon. Lastly, 34, the α-rays form a very intense shaft which is slightly, deflected,  and which is soon absorbed by the air. These, rays describe in the plane of the figure a path of great, curvature,  the direction of the deflection being the reverse, of that with the β-rays., If the receptacle is covered with a thin sheet of aluminium, (0·1 m.m. thick),  the α-rays are suppressed almost entirely, the β-rays are lessened,  and the γ-rays do not appear to be, absorbed to any great extent., Action of the Magnetic Field., We have seen that the rays emitted by radio-active, bodies have many properties common to cathode rays, and to Röntgen rays. Cathode rays,  as well as Röntgen, rays,  ionise the air,  act on photographic plates,  cause, fluorescence,  undergo no regular deflection. But the, cathode rays differ from Röntgen rays in being deflected, from their rectilinear path by the action of the magnetic, field,  and in the transportation of charges of negative, electricity., The fact that the magnetic field acts upon the rays, emitted by radio-active substances was discovered almost, simultaneously by MM. Giesel,  Meyer and von Schweidler, and Becquerel. These physicists observed that the rays, of radio-active substances are deflected by the magnetic, field in the same manner and direction as the cathode, rays; their observations were in relation to the β-rays., M. Curie demonstrated that the radiation of radium, comprises two groups of quite distinct rays,  of which one is, readily deflected by the magnetic field (β-rays),  whilst the, other seems to be unaffected by the action of this field (α-, and γ-rays)., M. Becquerel did not find that the specimens of polonium, prepared by us emitted rays of the cathode kind. On the, contrary,  he first noticed the effect of the magnetic field on, a specimen of polonium prepared by himself. None of the, polonium prepared by us ever gave rise to rays of the, cathode order., The polonium of M. Giesel only gives rise to these rays, when recently prepared,  and it is probable that the emission, is due to the phenomenon of induced radio-activity of which, we shall speak later., The following are experiments which prove that one, portion of the radiation of radium,  and one portion only, consists of easily deflected rays (β-rays). These experiments, were done according to the electrical method., 35, The radio-active body, A, (Fig. 5) sends forth radiations, in the direction, A D, between the plates, P, and, P′, . The plate, P, is now at a potential of 500 volts,  plate, P′, is connected to, an electrometer and to a quartz electric piezometer. The, intensity of the current passing through the air under the, influence of the radiations is measured. The magnetic, field can be established at will perpendicular to the plane, of the figure over the whole region, E E E E, . If the rays are, deflected,  even slightly,  they no longer pass between the, plates,  and the current is suppressed. The region of the, passage of the rays is surrounded with masses of lead, B, B′, B″,  and by the armatures of the, electro-magnet; when the rays are deflected, they are absorbed by the masses, of lead, B, and, B′, ., Fig. 5., The results obtained depend essentially, on the distance, A D,  of the radiating substance, A,  from the condenser at, D, . If, the distance, A D, is great enough (greater, than 7 c.m.),  most of the radium rays (90, to 100 per cent) arriving at the condenser, are deflected and suppressed for a field of, 2500 units. These are the β-rays. If the, distance, A D, is less than 65 m.m.,  a, smaller part of the rays are deflected by, the action of the field; this portion is also, entirely deflected by a field of 2500 units, and the proportion of the rays suppressed, is not increased by increasing the field from 2500 to, 7000 units., The proportion of the rays not suppressed by the field, increases with decrease of the distance, A D,  between the, radiating body and the condenser. For small distances, the rays which can be easily deflected form a very small, fraction of the total radiation. The penetrating rays are, therefore,  for the most part,  deviable rays of the cathode, order (β-rays)., Under the experimental conditions just described,  the, action of the magnetic field on the α-rays could not be well, observed for the fields employed. The chief radiation, apparently undergoing no deflection,  observed at a short, distance from the radiating source,  consisted of α-rays; the, undeflected radiation observed at a greater distance consisted, of γ-rays., If an absorbing lamina (aluminium or black paper) is, placed in the path of the bundle of rays,  those which pass, 36, through are nearly all deflected by the field in such a way, that,  with the aid of the screen and the magnetic field, almost all the radiation is suppressed in the condenser,  the, remainder being due to the γ-rays,  the proportion of which, is small. The α-rays are absorbed by the screen., An aluminium plate of 1/100 m.m. thickness is sufficient, for the suppression of almost all the rays not readily, deflected when the substance is far enough from the condenser;, for smaller distances (34 m.m. and 51 m.m.) two pieces, of this aluminium foil are necessary to give the same result., Similar determinations were made with four substances, containing radium (chlorides or carbonates) of very different, activity; analogous results were obtained., It may be remarked that,  in all cases,  the penetrating, rays deflected by the magnet (β-rays) form only a small, fraction of the total radiation; they influence but slightly, the determinations in which the whole radiation is made, use of to produce conductivity of the air., The radiation emitted by polonium may be studied by, the electrical method. When the distance, A D,  of the, polonium from the condenser is varied,  no current is observed, at first while the distance is fairly great; on nearing, the polonium,  the radiation suddenly becomes manifest, with great intensity; the current then increases uniformly, whilst approaching the polonium,  but the magnetic field, produces no appreciable effect under these conditions. The, radiation of polonium is apparently limited in space,  and, does not pass into the air beyond a kind of sheath surrounding, the substance to a thickness of several centimetres., The interpretation of the experiments I have just, described must be accompanied by some important general, reservations. In speaking of the proportion of the rays, deflected by the magnet,  I refer only to that portion of the, radiation capable of causing a current in the condenser. In, employing the fluorescent action of the Becquerel rays,  or, their action on photographic plates,  the proportion would, probably be different—a measure of intensity having,  as a, rule,  no meaning except for the method of measurement, adopted., The rays of polonium are α-rays. In the experiments, just described,  I observed no action of the magnetic field, upon them,  but the experimental conditions were such that, a slight deflection would pass unnoticed., The experiments made by the radiographic method confirmed, the preceding results. Taking radium as the source, of radiation,  and receiving the impression on a plate, 37, parallel to the primitive shaft and normal to the field,  a, very clear print is obtained of two shafts separated by the, action of the field,  the one deflected,  the other not deflected., The β-rays constitute the deflected beam; the, α-rays,  being very slightly deflected,  are not to be distinguished, from the undeflected bundle of the γ-rays., Deflected β-Rays., The experiments of M. Giesel and MM. Meyer and von, Schweidler showed that the radiation of the radio-active, bodies is,  in part at least,  deflected by a magnetic field,  and, that this deflection resembles that of the cathode rays. M., Becquerel investigated the action of the field on the rays, by the radiographic method. The experimental arrangement, was that of Fig. 4. The radium was placed in the, lead receptacle, P,  and this receptacle was placed on the, sensitive face of a photographic plate, A C,  covered with, black paper. The whole was placed between the poles of, an electro-magnet,  the magnetic field being normal to the, plane of the figure., If the field is directed to the back of this plane,  the part, B C, of the plate is acted upon by rays which,  after having, described circular paths,  return to the plate and strike it at, a right angle. These rays are β-rays., M. Becquerel has demonstrated that the impression, consists of a wide diffused band,  a continuous spectrum, indeed,  showing that the sheaf of deviable rays emitted by, the source is formed of an infinite number of radiations, unequally deflected. If the gelatin of the plate be covered, with different absorbent screens (paper,  glass,  metals),  one, portion of the spectrum is suppressed,  and it is found that, the rays most deflected by the magnetic field—otherwise, those which have the smallest radius of curvature—are the, most completely absorbed. With each screen,  the impression, on the plate begins at a certain distance from the, source of radiation,  this distance being proportional to the, absorptive power of the screen., Charge of the Deflected Rays., The cathode rays are,  as shown by M. Perrin,  charged, with negative electricity. Further,  according to the experiments, of M. Perrin and M. Lenard,  they are capable of, carrying their charge through the metallic envelopes connected, to earth and through isolating screens. At every, point where the cathode rays are absorbed,  there is a continuous, evolution of negative electricity. We have proved, 38, that the same is the case for the deflected β-rays of, radium., The deviable β-rays of radium are charged with, negative electricity., (, Note., —Let the radio-active substance be placed on one, of the plates of a condenser,  this plate being connected to, earth; the second plate is connected to an electrometer,  it, receives and absorbs the rays emitted by the substance. If, the rays are charged,  a continuous flow of electricity into, the electrometer should be observed. In this experiment, carried out in air,  we were not able to detect a charge, accompanying the rays,  but such an experiment is not, delicate. The air between the plates being caused by the, rays to conduct,  the electrometer is no longer isolated,  and, can only respond to charges if these be sufficiently strong., In order that the α-rays may not interfere with the, experiment,  they may be suppressed by covering the source, of radiation with a thin metallic screen. We repeated this, experiment,  without more success,  by causing the rays, to pass through the interior of a Faraday cylinder in, connection with the electrometer)., According to the preceding experiments,  it was evident, that the charge of the rays of the radiating body employed, was a weak one., In order to fix a feeble evolution of electricity upon the, conductor which absorbs the rays,  this conductor should be, completely insulated; this is effected by screening it from, the air,  either by placing it in a tube with a very perfect, vacuum,  or by surrounding it with a good solid dielectric., We employed the latter arrangement., Fig. 6., A conducting disc, M M, (Fig. 6),  is connected by the wire, t,  to the electrometer;, the disc, and wire are completely, enveloped, by the insulating, substance, i i i i, ;, the whole is again, surrounded with, the metallic, covering, E E E E,  which is in electric connection with the, earth. The insulator, p p,  and the metallic envelope are very, thin upon one of the faces of the disc. This face is exposed to, the radiation of the barium and radium salt, R,  placed outside, in a lead receptacle. The rays emitted by the radium, penetrate the metallic envelope and the insulating lamina, p p,  and are absorbed by the metallic disc, M M, . The latter, 39, then becomes the source of a continuous evolution of, negative electricity,  as determined by the electrometer,  and, is measured by means of a quartz piezometer., The current thus created is very weak. With very, active barium-radium chloride,  forming a layer of 2·5 sq., c.m. in area,  and of 0·2 c.m. in thickness,  a current of, magnitude 10, –11, ampères is obtained,  the rays utilised, having traversed,  before being absorbed by the disc, M M,  a, thickness of aluminium of 0·01 m.m.,  and a thickness of, ebonite of 0·3 m.m., We used successively lead,  copper,  and zinc for the disc, M M,  ebonite and paraffin for the insulator; the results, obtained were the same., The current diminishes with increasing distance from the, source of radiation, R,  also when a less active product is used., We obtained the same results again when the disc, M M, is, replaced by a Faraday cylinder filled with air,  and covered, outside with insulating material. The opening of the, cylinder,  closed by the thin insulating plate, p p,  was, opposite the radiating source., Fig. 7., Finally,  we made the inverse experiment,  which was to, place the lead receptacle with the radium in the centre of, the insulating material and in connection with the electrometer, (Fig. 7),  the whole being surrounded with the, metallic covering connected to earth., Under these conditions,  it is evident from the electrometer, that the radium has a positive charge equal in magnitude to, the negative charge of the former experiment. The radium, rays penetrate the thin dielectric plate, p p,  and leave the, conductor inside carrying with them negative electricity., The α-rays of radium do not interfere in these experiments, being almost completely absorbed by a very thin layer of, matter. The method just described is not suitable for the study, of the charge of the rays of polonium,  these rays very slightly, penetrating. We observed no indication of any charge in the, case of polonium,  which gives rise to α-rays only; but,  for, the reason just given,  no conclusion can be drawn from this., 40, Thus,  in the case of the deflected β-rays of radium,  as, in the case of cathode rays,  the rays carry a charge of, electricity. But,  hitherto,  the existence of electric charges, uncombined with matter has been unknown. In the study, of the emission of the β-rays of radium,  we are therefore, led to make use of the theory which is in vogue for the, study of cathode rays. In this ballistic theory,  formulated, by Sir William Crookes,  since developed and completed by, Prof. J. J. Thomson,  the cathode rays consist of extremely, minute particles,  which are hurled from the cathode with, great velocity,  and which are charged with negative, electricity. We might similarly conceive that radium, sends into space negatively electrified particles., A specimen of radium,  enclosed in a solid thin perfectly, insulated envelope,  should become spontaneously charged, to a very high potential. By the ballistic hypothesis the, potential would increase until the potential difference of, the surrounding conductors became sufficient to hinder the, ejection of the electrified particles and to cause their return, to the source of radiation., We have performed an experiment on these lines. A, specimen of very active radium was enclosed for some time, in a glass vessel. In order to open the vessel,  we made a, trace on the glass with a glass cutter. Whilst so doing, we clearly heard the report of a spark,  and upon examining, the vessel with a magnifying glass,  we observed that the, glass had been pierced by a spark at the spot where it had, been weakened by the scratch. The phenomenon produced, is comparable to the rupture of the glass of an overcharged, Leyden jar., The same phenomenon occurred with another glass., Further,  at the moment of the passing of the spark,  M., Curie,  who was holding the glass,  felt the electric shock of, discharge in his fingers., Certain kinds of glass have good insulating properties., If the radium is enclosed in a sealed glass vessel,  well, insulated,  it is to be expected that,  at a given moment,  the, vessel will be spontaneously perforated., Radium is the first example of a body which is spontaneously, charged with electricity., Action of the Electric Field upon the Deflected β-Rays of Radium., The β-rays of radium,  being analogous to the cathode, rays,  should be deflected by an electric field in a manner, similar to the latter;, i.e.,  as would a particle of matter, 41, negatively charged and hurled into space with a great, velocity. The existence of such a deflection has been, demonstrated both by M. Dorn and M. Becquerel., Let us consider the case of a ray which traverses the, space situated between the two plates of a condenser., Suppose the direction of the ray parallel to the plates: when, an electric field is established between the latter,  the ray is, subjected to the action of this uniform field along its whole, path in the condenser l. By reason of this action the ray, is deflected towards the positive plate and describes the arc, of a parabola; on leaving the field,  it continues its path in, a straight line,  following the tangent to the arc of the, parabola at the point of exit. The ray can be received on, a photographic plate perpendicular to its original direction., Observations are taken of the impression produced on the, plate when the field is zero,  and when it has a known, value,  and from that is deduced the value of the deflection, δ,  which is the distance of the points in which the new, direction of the ray and its original direction meet a, common plane perpendicular to the original direction. If, h is the distance of this plane from the condenser, i.e.,  at, the edge of the field,  we have,  by a simple calculation, —, m, being the mass of the moving particles, e, its charge, v, its, velocity,  and F the strength of the field., The experiments of M. Becquerel enable him to assign a, value approaching to δ., Relation of the Charge to the Mass for a Particle Negatively Charged Emitted by Radium., When a material particle having a mass, m, and a negative, charge, e,  is projected with a velocity, v, into a uniform magnetic, field perpendicular to its initial velocity,  this particle, describes,  in a plane normal to the field and passing through, its initial velocity,  an arc of a circle of radius ρ,  so that—H, being the strength of the field—we have the relation—, If,  for the same ray,  the deflection,  δ,  and the radius of, curvature,  ρ,  be measured in a magnetic field,  values could, be found from these two experiments for the ratio, e, m, and for, the velocity, v, ., 42, The experiments of M. Becquerel threw the first light, upon this subject. They gave for the ratio, e, m, a value approximately, equal to 10, 7, absolute electro-magnetic units, and for v a magnitude of 1·6 × 10, 10, . These values are of the, same order of magnitude as those of the cathode rays., Accurate experiments have been made on the same subject, by M. Kaufmann. This physicist subjected a narrow beam, of radium rays to the simultaneous action of an electric field, and a magnetic field,  the two fields being uniform and having, a similar direction,  normal to the original direction of the, beam. The impression produced on a plate normal to the, primitive beam and placed beyond the limits of the field with, reference to the source,  has the form of a curve,  each point, of which corresponds to one of the original beam. The, most penetrating and least deflected rays are at the same, time those with the greatest velocity., It follows from the experiments of M. Kaufmann,  that for, the radium rays,  of which the velocity is considerably greater, than that of the cathode rays,  the ratio, e, m, decreases,  while, the velocity increases., According to the researches of J. J. Thomson and Townsend, we may assume that the moving particle,  which constitutes, the ray,  possesses a charge, e,  equal to that carried by, an atom of hydrogen during electrolysis,  this charge being, the same for all the rays. We are therefore led to the conclusion, that the mass of the particle, m,  increases with, increase of velocity., These theoretical considerations lead to the idea that the, inertia of the particle is due to its state of charge during, motion,  the velocity of an electric charge in motion being, incapable of modification without expenditure of energy. To, state it otherwise,  the inertia of the particle is of electro-magnetic, origin,  and the mass of the particle is—in part at, least—a virtual mass or an electro-magnetic mass. M., Abraham goes further,  and assumes that the mass of the, particle is entirely an electro-magnetic mass. If,  according, to this hypothesis,  the value of this mass, m,  be calculated, for a known velocity, v,  we find that, m, approaches infinity, when, v, approaches the velocity of light,  and that, m, approaches, a constant value when the velocity, v,  is much less than that, of light. The experiments of M. Kaufmann are in agreement, with the results of this theory,  the importance of which is, great because it foreshadows the possibility of establishing, 43, mechanical bases upon the dynamical of little particles of, matter charged in a state of motion., These are the figures obtained by M. Kaufmann for, e, m, and, v, ., e, m, Electro-magnetic units., v, c.m., sec., 1·865, × 10, 7, 0·7, × 10, 10, For cathode rays (Simon)., 1·31, × 10, 7, 2·36, × 10, 10, For radium rays (Kaufmann)., 1·17, × 10, 7, 2·48, × 10, 10, 0·97, × 10, 7, 2·59, × 10, 10, 0·77, × 10, 7, 2·72, × 10, 10, 0·63, × 10, 7, 2·83, × 10, 10, M. Kaufmann concludes,  from comparison of his experiments, with the theory,  that the limiting value of the ratio, e, m, for radium rays of relatively small velocity would be the, same as the value, e, m, for cathode rays., The most complete experiments of M. Kaufmann were, made with a minute quantity of pure radium chloride,  with, which we provided him., According to M. Kaufmann’s experiments,  certain β-rays, of radium possess a velocity very near to that of light., These rapid rays seem to possess great penetrating capacity, towards matter., Action of the Magnetic Field upon the α-Rays., In a recent work,  Mr. Rutherford announced that,  in a, powerful electric or magnetic field,  the α-rays of radium are, slightly deflected,  in the manner of particles positively electrified, and possessing great velocity. Mr. Rutherford concludes, from his experiments that the velocity of the α-rays is of the, order of magnitude 2·5 × 10, 9, c.m., sec., and that the ratio, e, m, for, these rays is of the order of magnitude 6 × 10, 3,  which is 10, 4, times as great as for the deflected β-rays. We shall see, later that these conclusions of Mr. Rutherford are in agreement, with the properties already known of the α-radiation, and that they account,  in part at least,  for the law of absorption, of this radiation., The experiments of Mr. Rutherford have been confirmed, by M. Becquerel. M. Becquerel has further demonstrated, that polonium rays behave in a magnetic field like the α-rays, 44, of radium,  and that,  for the same field,  they seem to have, the same curvature as the latter., It also appears from M. Becquerel’s experiments that the, α-rays do not form a magnetic spectrum,  but act rather like a, homogeneous radiation,  all the rays being equally deflected., Action of the Magnetic Field on the Rays of other Radio-active Substances., We have just seen that radium gives off α-rays comparable, to the tube rays,  β-rays comparable to cathode rays, and γ-rays which are penetrating and not deflected. Polonium, gives off α-rays only. Amongst the other radio-active, substances,  actinium seems to behave like radium,  but the, study of its radiation has not yet advanced so far as in the, case of radium. As regards the faintly radio-active bodies, we know to-day that uranium and thorium give rise to α-rays, as well as β-rays (Becquerel,  Rutherford)., Proportion of β-Rays in the Radiation of Radium., As I have already mentioned,  the proportion of β-rays increases, with increase of distance from the source of radiation., These rays never occur alone,  and for great distances the, presence of γ-rays is always discernible. The presence of, very penetrating,  undeflected rays in the radiation of radium, was first observed by M. Villard. These rays constitute only, a small portion of the radiation measured by the electrical, method,  and their presence escaped our notice in our first, experiments,  so that we believed falsely that the radiation at, great distances contained only rays capable of deflection., The following are the numerical results obtained with experiments, made by the electrical method with an apparatus, similar to that of Fig. 5. The radium was only separated, from the condenser by the surrounding air. I shall indicate, by the letter, d, the distance from the source of radiation to, the condenser. The numbers of the second line represent, the current subsisting when the magnetic field is acting, supposing the current obtained with no field equal to 100 for, each distance. These numbers may be considered as giving, the percentage of the total α- and γ-rays,  the deflection of, the α-rays having been scarcely observable with the conditions, employed., At great distances there are no α-rays,  and the undeflected, radiation is therefore of the γ kind only., Experiments made at short distances:—, d,  in centimetres, 3·4, 5·1, 6·0, 6·5, Percentage of undeflected rays, 74, 56, 33, 11, 45, Experiments made at long distances with a product considerably, more active than that which was used for the preceding, series:—, d,  in centimetres, 14, 30, 53, 80, 98, Percentage of undeflected rays, 12, 14, 17, 14, 16, d, 124, 157, Percentage of undeflected rays, 14, 11, It is thus evident that after a certain distance the proportion, of undeflected rays in the radiation is approximately, constant. These rays probably all belong to the γ species., The following is another series of experiments in which, the radium was enclosed in a very narrow glass tube,  placed, below the condenser and parallel to the plates. The rays, emitted traversed a certain thickness of glass and air before, entering the condenser:—, d,  in centimetres, 2·5, 3·3, 4·1, 5·9, 7·5, 9·6, 11·3, Percentage rays not deflected, 33, 33, 21, 16, 14, 10, 9, d, 13·9, 17·2, Percentage rays not deflected, 9, 10, As in the preceding experiments,  the number of the, second line approximate to a constant value,  when the, distance, d, increases,  but the limit is reached for smaller, distances than in the preceding series,  because the α-rays, have been more completely absorbed by the glass than the, β- and γ-rays., The following experiment shows that a thin sheet of, aluminium (0·01 m.m. thick) absorbs principally α-rays., The product being placed 5 c.m. from the condenser,  the, proportion of rays other than β,  when the magnetic field is, acting,  is about 71 per cent. When the same substance is, covered with the sheet of aluminium,  the distance remaining, the same,  the radiation transmitted is found to be, almost totally deflected by the magnetic field,  the α-rays, having been absorbed by the aluminium. The same result, is obtained when paper is used as the absorbing screen., The greatest part of the radiation of radium consists of, α-rays,  which are probably emitted principally by the, superficial layer of the radiating matter. When the thickness, of the layer of radiating matter is varied,  the intensity, of the current increases with this thickness; the increase is, not proportional to the thickness for the whole of the, radiation; it is,  moreover,  more considerable for the β-rays, than for the α-rays,  so that the proportion of β-rays increases, with the thickness of the active layer. The source of, 46, radiation being placed at a distance of 5 c.m. from the, condenser,  it is found that for a thickness equal to 0·4, m.m. of the active layer,  the total radiation is given by the, number 28,  and the proportion of the β-rays is 29 per cent., By making the layer 2 m.m. thick, i.e.,  five times as thick, a total radiation equal to 102,  and a proportion of β-rays, equal to 45 per cent are obtained. The total radiation, which exists at this distance has therefore been increased, in the ratio of 3·6,  and the β-radiation has become five, times as strong., The preceding experiments were made by the electrical, method. When the radiographic method is used,  certain, results seem to be in contradiction with what precedes. In, the experiments of M. Villard,  a beam of radium rays,  subjected, to the action of the magnetic field,  was received on, to a pile of photographic plates. The undeflected and, penetrating γ-beam passed through all the plates,  leaving, its trace on each. The deflected β-beam produced an impression, on the first plate only. This beam appeared, therefore to contain no rays of great penetration., On the contrary,  in our experiments a beam which is, propagated in the air contains at the greatest distances, accessible to observation about 9/10 of β-rays,  and the same, is the case when the source of radiation is enclosed in a little, sealed glass vessel. In M. Villard’s experiments,  these, deflected and penetrating β-rays did not affect the photographic, plates beyond the first,  because they are to a great, extent diffused in all directions by the first solid obstacle, encountered,  and no longer form a beam. In our experiments, the rays given off by radium and transmitted through, the glass of the vessel were also probably scattered by the, glass,  but the vessel being very small would itself act as a, source of β-rays at its surface,  and we were able to follow, the course of the latter to a great distance from the vessel., The cathode rays of Crookes tubes can only traverse, very thin screens (aluminium screens of 0·01 m.m. thickness)., A beam of rays striking the screen normally is, scattered in all directions; but the diffusion becomes less, with diminishing thickness of the screen,  and for very thin, screens the emerging beam is practically the prolongation, of the incident beam., The deflected β-rays of radium behave in a similar, manner,  but the transmitted beam experiences,  for the, same thickness of screen,  a much slighter modification., According to the experiments of M. Becquerel,  the very, readily deflected β-rays of radium (those with a relatively, 47, small velocity) are powerfully scattered by an aluminium, screen of thickness 0·1 m.m.; but the penetrating and less, deflected rays (rays of the cathode kind of great velocity), pass through this screen without being sensibly diffused, whatever be the inclination of the screen to the direction of, the beam. The β-rays of great velocity penetrate without, diffusion a much greater thickness of paraffin (several centimetres), and in this the curvature of the beam produced, by the magnetic field can be traced. The thicker the, screen,  and the more absorbent the material of which it, is composed,  the greater is the modification of the deflected, primitive beam,  because,  with increasing thickness of, screen,  diffusion occurs progressively among fresh groups of, rays of increasing penetration., The β-rays of radium experience a diffusion in passing, through the air,  which is very marked for readily deflected, rays,  but which is much slighter than that produced by, equal thicknesses of solid substances. For this reason,  the, β-rays traverse long distances in the air., Penetrating Power of the Radiation of Radio-active Bodies., Since the beginning of the researches on radio-active, bodies,  investigations of the absorption produced by different, screens upon the rays given off by these bodies have been, carried on. In a previous paper on this subject I gave, figures (quoted at the beginning of this work) representing, the penetrating power of uranium and thorium rays. Mr., Rutherford has made a special study of the radiation of, uranium,  and proved it to be heterogeneous. Mr. Owens, has arrived at the same results for thorium rays. When, the discovery of strongly radio-active bodies immediately, followed upon this,  the penetrating power of their rays was, also studied by various physicists (Becquerel,  Meyer and, von Schweidler,  Curie,  Rutherford). The first observations, brought to light the complexity of the radiation,  which, seems to be a general phenomenon,  and common to the, radio-active bodies. In them we have sources which give, rise to a variety of radiations,  each of which has a power, of penetration proper to itself., Radio-active bodies emit rays which are propagated both, in the air and, in vacuo, . The propagation is rectilinear;, this fact is proved by the distinctness and shape of the, shadows formed by interposing bodies opaque to the radiation, between the source and the sensitive plate or fluorescent, screen which serves as receiver,  the source being of small, magnitude in comparison with its distance from the receiver., 48, Various experiments demonstrating the rectilinear propagation, of uranium,  radium,  and polonium rays have been, made by M. Becquerel., It is interesting to know the distance that rays can travel, in air. We have found that radium emits rays which can, be detected in the air at a distance of several metres from, the source. In certain of our electrical determinations,  the, action of the source upon the air of the condenser made, itself felt at a distance of between 2 and 3 metres. We, have also obtained fluorescent effects and radiographic impressions, at similar distances. The experiments are not, easily carried out,  except with very intense radio-active, sources,  because,  independently of the absorption by the, air,  the action upon a given receiver varies inversely as the, square of the distance from a source of small dimensions., This radiation,  which travels a long distance in the case of, radium,  comprises rays of the cathode kind and rays which, are undeflected; however,  the deflected rays predominate, according to the results of the experiments already mentioned., The greater part of the radiation (α-rays) is,  on, the contrary,  limited in air to a distance of about 7 c.m., from the source., I made several experiments with radium enclosed in a, little glass vessel. The rays emerging from the vessel, after traversing a certain space of air,  were received in a, condenser,  which served to measure their ionising capacity, by the usual electrical method. The distance, d,  from the, source to the condenser was varied,  and the current of, saturation, i,  obtained in the condenser was measured., The following are the results of one of the series of determinations:—, d,  c.m., i., i, ×, d, 2, × 10, –3, ., 10, 127, 13, 20, 38, 15, 30, 17·4, 16, 40, 10·5, 17, 50, 6·9, 17, 60, 4·7, 17, 70, 3·8, 19, 100, 1·65, 17, After a certain distance,  the intensity of radiation varies, inversely as the square of the distance from the condenser., The radiation of polonium is only propagated in air to a, distance of a few centimetres (4 to 6 c.m.) from the source, of radiation., 49, In the case of the absorption of radiations by solid, screens,  we find another fundamental difference between, radium and polonium. Radium emits rays capable of, penetrating great thicknesses of solid matter, e.g.,  several, centimetres of lead or of glass. The rays which have, passed through a great thickness of a solid body are extremely, penetrating,  and it is practically impossible to, absorb them entirely by any material whatever. But these, rays form only a small fraction of the total radiation,  the, greater part of which is absorbed by a slight thickness of, solid matter., Polonium emits rays which are readily absorbed,  and, which can only pass through extremely thin screens., The following are figures showing the absorption produced, by an aluminium lamina of thickness 0·01 m.m., This lamina was placed above and almost in contact with, the substance. The direct radiation and that transmitted, by the aluminium were measured by the electrical method, (apparatus of Fig. 1); the current of saturation was, practically obtained in every case. I have represented the, activity of the radiating body by, a,  that of uranium being, unity., a., Fraction of radiation transmitted., Chloride of barium and radium, 57, 0·32, Bromide of barium and radium, 43, 0·30, Chloride of barium and radium, 1200, 0·30, Sulphate of barium and radium, 5000, 0·29, Sulphate of barium and radium, 10, 000, 0·32, Metallic bismuth and polonium, 0·22, Compounds of uranium, 0·20, Compounds of thorium in a thin layer, 0·38, We see that radium compounds of different nature and, activity give very similar results,  as I have already pointed, out in the case of uranium and thorium compounds at the, beginning of this work. We see also that,  taking into, account the whole of the radiation,  and with a given, absorbent screen,  the different radio-active bodies can be, arranged in the following decreasing order of penetrating, power:—Thorium,  radium,  polonium,  uranium., These results are similar to those which have been published, by Mr. Rutherford., Mr. Rutherford also finds that the order is the same when, air is the absorbent substance. But it is probable that this, order has no absolute value,  and would not be maintained, 50, independently of the nature and thickness of the screen., Experiment shows,  indeed,  that the law of absorption is, very different for polonium and radium,  and that,  for the, latter,  the absorption of the rays of each of the three groups, must be considered separately., Polonium is particularly well adapted to the study of α-rays, because the specimens which we possess emit no, other kind of rays. I made a preliminary series of experiments, with extremely active recently prepared specimens of, polonium. I found the absorbability of the rays to increase, with increase of thickness of the matter traversed. This, singular law of absorption is contrary to that known for, other kinds of radiation., I employed for this research our apparatus for the determination, of electrical conductivity arranged in the following, manner:—, The two plates of a condenser, P P, and, P′ P′, (Fig 8),  are, horizontally disposed in a metallic box, B B B B,  connected, to earth. The active body, A,  placed in a thick metallic, box, C C C C,  connected, with the, plate, P′ P′,  acts, upon the air of, the condenser, across a metallic, sheet, T, ; the, rays which pass, through the, sheet are alone, utilised for producing, the current, the electric, field being, limited by the, sheet. The distance, A T,  of the, active body from, the sheet may be varied. The field between the plates is, established by means of a battery. By placing in, A, upon the, active body different screens,  and by adjusting the distance, A T,  the absorption of rays which travel long or short distances, in the air may be determined., Fig. 8., The following are the results obtained with polonium:—, For a certain value of the distance, A T, (4 c.m. and more), no current passes; the rays do not penetrate the condenser., When the distance, A T, is diminished,  the appearance of the, 51, rays in the condenser is manifested somewhat suddenly,  a, weak current changing to one of considerable strength for, a slight diminution of distance; the current then increases, regularly as the active body continues to approach the, sheet, T, ., When the active body is covered with a sheet of, aluminium 1/100 m.m. thick,  the absorption produced by, the lamina becomes greater,  the greater the distance, A T, ., If a second similar lamina of aluminium be placed upon, the first,  each absorbs a fraction of the radiation it receives, and this fraction is greater for the second lamina than for, the first., In the following table I have represented in the first line, the distances in centimetres between the polonium and the, sheet, T, ; in the second line the percentage of the rays, transmitted by a sheet of aluminium; in the third line the, percentage of the rays transmitted by two sheets of the, same aluminium:—, Distance, A T, 3·5, 2·5, 1·9, 1·45, 0·5, Percentage of rays transmitted by one lamina, 0, 0, 5, 10, 25, Percentage of rays transmitted by two laminæ, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0·7, In these experiments the distance of the plates, P, and, P′, was 3 c.m. We see that the interposition of the, aluminium screen diminishes the intensity of the radiation, to a greater degree at further distances than at nearer, distances., This effect is still more marked than the preceding, figures seem to indicate. For a distance of 0·5 c.m. 25, per cent represents the mean penetration for all the rays, which pass beyond this distance. If,  for example,  only, those rays between 0·5 c.m. and 1 c.m. be comprehended, the penetration would be greater. And if the plate, P, be, placed at a distance of 0·5 c.m. from, P′, the fraction of the, radiation transmitted by the aluminium lamina (for, A T, = 0·5, c.m.) is 47 per cent,  and through two laminæ it is 5 per, cent of the original radiation., I have recently performed a second series of experiments, with these same specimens of polonium,  the activity of, which was considerably diminished,  the interval of time, between the two series of experiments being three years., In the former experiments,  polonium nitrite was used; in, the latter,  the polonium was in the state of metallic particles, obtained by fusing the nitrite with potassium cyanide., 52, I found that the radiation of polonium had preserved its, essential characteristics,  and I discovered new results. The, following,  for different values of the distance, A T,  are the, fractions of the radiation transmitted by a screen composed, of four superposed very thin leaves of beaten aluminium., Distance, A T,  in centimetres, 0, 1·5, 2·6, Percentage of rays transmitted by the screen, 76, 66, 39, I also found that the fraction of the radiation absorbed, by a given screen increases with the thickness of the, material already traversed by the radiation,  but this only, occurs after the distance, A T, has reached a certain value., When this distance is zero (the polonium being in contact, with the sheet,  either outside or inside the condenser),  it is, observed that with several similar superposed screens,  each, absorbs the same fraction of the radiation it receives;, otherwise expressed,  the intensity of the radiation diminishes, therefore according to an exponential law as a function of, the thickness of the material traversed,  as in the case, of homogeneous radiation transmitted by the lamina without, changing its nature., The following numerical results are given with reference, to these experiments:—, For a distance, A T, equal to 1·5 c.m. a thin aluminium, screen transmits the fraction 0·51 of the radiation it receives, when acting alone,  and the fraction 0·34 of the radiation it, receives when it is preceded by another similar screen., On the contrary,  for a distance, A T, equal to zero,  the, same screen transmits in both the cases considered the same, fraction of the radiation it receives,  and this fraction is equal, to 0·71; it is therefore greater than in the preceding case., The following numbers indicate for a distance, A T, equal, to 0 and for a succession of thin superposed screens,  the, ratio of the radiation transmitted to the radiation received, for each screen:—, Series of nine very thin copper leaves., Series of seven very thin aluminium leaves., 0·72, 0.69, 0·78, 0.94, 0·75, 0.95, 0·77, 0.91, 0·70, 0.92, 0·77, 0.93, 0·69, 0.94, 0·79, 0·68, 53, Taking into account the difficulties of the manipulation, of very thin screens and of the superposition of screens in, contact,  the numbers of each column may be looked upon, as constant; the first number only of the aluminium, column indicates a greater absorption than that indicated, by the following numbers., The α-rays of radium behave similarly to the rays of, polonium. These rays may be investigated almost isolated, by deflecting to one side the β-rays with the magnetic, field; the γ-rays seem of slight importance in comparison, with the α-rays. The operation can only be carried on at, some distance from the source of radiation. The following, are the results of an experiment of this kind. The fraction, of the radiation transmitted by a lamina of aluminium 0·01, m.m. thick is measured; this screen was placed always, in the same position,  above and at a little distance from, the source of radiation. With the apparatus of Fig. 5,  the, current produced in the condenser for different values of, the distance, A D, is observed,  both with and without the, screen:—, Distance, A D, 6·0, 5·1, 3·4, Percentage of rays transmitted by the aluminium, 3, 7, 24, The rays which travel furthest in the air are those most, absorbed by the aluminium. There is therefore a great, similarity between the absorbable α-rays of radium and the, rays of polonium., The deflected β-rays and the undeflected penetrating γ-rays, are,  on the contrary,  of a different nature. The experiments, notably of MM. Meyer and von Schweidler, clearly show that,  considering the radiation of radium as a, whole,  the penetrating power of this radiation increases, with the thickness of the material traversed,  as is the case, of Röntgen rays. In these experiments the α-rays produce, scarcely any effect,  being for the most part suppressed by, very thin absorbent screens. Those which penetrate are, on the one hand,  β-rays more or less scattered; on the, other hand,  γ-rays,  which appear similar to Röntgen rays., The following are the results of some of my experiments, on the subject:—, The radium is enclosed in a glass vessel. The rays, which emerge from the vessel,  traverse 30 c.m. of air,  and, are received upon a series of glass plates,  each of thickness, 1·3 m.m.; the first plate transmits 49 per cent of the radiation, it receives,  the second transmits 84 per cent of the, 54, radiation it receives,  the third transmits 85 per cent of the, radiation it receives., In another series of experiments the radium was enclosed, in a glass vessel placed 10 c.m. from the condenser which, received the rays. A series of similar screens of lead each, 0·115 m.m. thick were placed on the vessel., The ratio of the radiation transmitted to the radiation, received is given for each of the successive screens by the, following numbers:—, 0·40 0·60 0·72 0·79 0·89 0·92 0·94 0·94 0·97, For a series of four screens of lead,  each of which was, 1·5 m.m. thick,  the ratio of the radiation transmitted to the, radiation received was given for the successive screens by, the following numbers:—, 0·09 0·78 0·84 0·82, The results of these experiments show that when the, thickness of the lead traversed increases from 0·1 m.m. to, 6 m.m.,  the penetrating power of the radiation increases., I found that,  under the experimental conditions mentioned, a screen of lead 1·8 c.m. thick transmits 2 per cent, of the radiation it receives; a screen of lead 5·3 c.m. thick, transmits 0·4 per cent of the radiation it receives. I also, found that the radiation transmitted by a thickness of lead, of 1·5 m.m. consists largely of rays capable of deflection, (cathode order). The latter are therefore capable of, traversing not only great distances in the air,  but also considerable, thicknesses of very absorbent solids,  such as lead., In investigating with the apparatus of Fig. 2 the absorption, exercised by an aluminium screen 0·01 m.m. thick, upon the total radiation of radium,  the screen being always, placed at the same distance from the radiating body,  and, the condenser being placed at a variable distance, A D,  the, results obtained are the sum of those due to the three, groups of the radiation. At a long distance the penetrating, rays predominate,  and the absorption is slight; at a short, distance the α-rays predominate,  and the absorption becomes, less with nearer approach to the substance; for an, intermediate distance the absorption passes through a, maximum and the penetration through a minimum., Distance, A D, 7·1, 6·5, 6·0, 5·1, 3·4, Percentage of rays transmitted by aluminium, 91, 82, 58, 41, 48, Certain experiments made in connection with absorption, always demonstrate a certain similarity between the α-rays, 55, and the β-rays. Thus it was that M. Becquerel discovered, that the absorbent action of a solid screen upon the β-rays, increases with the distance of the screen from the source, such that if the rays are subjected to a magnetic field,  as, in Fig. 4,  a screen placed in contact with the source of, radiation allows a larger portion of the magnetic spectrum, to be in evidence than does the same screen placed upon, the photographic plate. This variation of the absorbent, effect of the screen with the distance of the screen from the, source is similar to that which occurs with the α-rays; this, has been verified by MM. Meyer and von Schweidler,  who, operated by means of the fluoroscopic method; M. Curie, and I observed the same fact when working by the, electrical method. However,  when the radium is enclosed, in a glass tube and placed at a distance from the condenser, which is itself enclosed in a thin aluminium box,  it becomes, a matter of indifference whether the screen be placed, against the source or against the condenser; the current, obtained is the same in both cases., The investigation of the α-rays led me to the reflection, that these rays behave like projectiles having a certain, initial velocity,  and which lose their force on encountering, obstacles. These rays,  moreover,  travel by rectilinear, propagation,  as has been shown by M. Becquerel in the, following experiment:—Polonium emitting rays was, placed in a very narrow straight cavity hollowed in a sheet, of cardboard. Thus a linear source of radiation was produced., A copper wire,  1·5 m.m. in diameter,  was placed, parallel and opposite to the source at a distance of 4·9 m.m., Beyond was placed a parallel photographic plate at a distance, of 8·65 m.m. After an exposure of ten minutes,  the, geometric shadow of the wire was perfectly reproduced, with a narrow penumbra corresponding to the size of the, source. The same experiment succeeded equally well, when a double leaf of beaten aluminium was placed against, the wire,  through which the rays must pass., There are therefore rays capable of giving perfect, geometric shadows. The experiment with the aluminium, shows that these rays are not scattered in traversing the, screen,  and that this screen does not give rise to any, noticeable extent to secondary rays similar to the secondary, rays of the Röntgen rays., The experiments of Mr. Rutherford show that the projectiles, which constitute the α-rays are deflected by a, magnetic field,  as if they were positively charged. The, deflection in a magnetic field becomes less as the product, 56, mv, e, becomes greater;, m, being the mass of the particle, v, its velocity,  and, e, its charge. The cathode rays of radium, are but slightly deflected,  because their velocity is, enormous; they are,  on the other hand,  very penetrating, because each particle has a very small mass together with, a great velocity. But particles which,  with an equal, charge and a less velocity,  have a greater mass,  would be, also only slightly influenced by the action of the field,  and, would give rise to very absorbable rays. From the results, of Mr. Rutherford’s experiments,  this seems to take place in, the case of the α-rays., The penetrating γ-rays appear to be of quite another, nature and similar to Röntgen rays., We have now seen how complex a phenomenon is the, radiation of radio-active bodies. The difficulties of investigation, are increased by the question as to whether the, radiation undergoes a merely selective absorption on the, part of the material,  or whether a more or less radical, transformation., Little is so far known with regard to this question. If, the radiation of radium be regarded as containing rays both, of the cathode and Röntgen species,  it might be expected, to undergo transformations in traversing screens. It is, known:—Firstly,  that cathode rays emerging from a, Crookes tube through an aluminium window are greatly, scattered by the aluminium; and,  further,  that the passage, through the screen entails a diminution of the velocity of, the rays. In this way,  cathode rays with a velocity equal, to 1·4 × 10, 10, c.m. lose 10 per cent of their velocity in, passing through 0·01 m.m. of aluminium. Secondly, cathode rays on striking an obstacle give rise to the production, of Röntgen rays. Thirdly,  Röntgen rays,  on, striking a solid obstacle,  give rise to the production of, secondary rays,  which partly consist of cathode rays., The existence,  by analogy,  of all these preceding phenomena, may therefore be predicted for the rays of radio-active, substances., In investigating the transmission of polonium rays, through a screen of aluminium,  M. Becquerel observed, neither the production of secondary rays nor any transformation, into cathode rays., I endeavoured to demonstrate a transformation of the, rays of polonium by using the method of interchangeable, screens. Two superposed screens, E, 1, and, E, 2,  being, traversed by the rays,  the order in which they are traversed, 57, should be immaterial if the passage through the screens, does not transform the rays; if,  on the contrary,  each, screen transforms the rays during transmission,  the order, of the screens is of moment. If,  for example,  the rays are, transformed into more absorbable rays in passing through, lead,  and no such effect is produced by aluminium,  then, the system lead-aluminium will be more opaque than the, system aluminium-lead; this takes place with Röntgen, rays., My experiments show that this phenomenon is produced, with the rays of polonium. The apparatus employed was, that of Fig. 8. The polonium was placed in the box, C C C C,  and the absorbing screens,  of necessity very thin, were placed upon the metallic sheet T., Screens employed., Thickness., M.m., Current observed., Aluminium, 0·01, 17·9, Brass, 0·005, Brass, 0·005, 6·7, Aluminium, 0·01, Aluminium, 0·01, 150, Tin, 0·005, Tin, 0·005, 125, Aluminium, 0·01, Tin, 0·005, 13·9, Brass, 0·005, Brass, 0·005, 4·4, Tin, 0·005, The results obtained prove that the radiation is modified, in passing through a solid screen. This conclusion accords, with the experiments in which,  of two similar superposed, metallic screens,  the first is less absorbent than the second., From this it is probable that the transforming action of a, screen increases with the distance of the screen from the, source. This fact has not been verified,  and the nature of, the transformation has not been studied in detail., I repeated the same experiments with a very active salt, of radium; the result was negative. I only observed, insignificant variations in the intensity of the radiation, transmitted with interchange of the order of the screens., The following systems of screens were experimented, with:—, 58, Aluminium,  thickness, 0·55  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 0·55  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 0·55  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 1·07  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 0·55  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 1·07  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 0·15  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 0·15  m.m., Aluminium,  thickness, 0·15  m.m., Platinum,  thickness, 0·01  m.m., Lead,  thickness, 0·1   m.m., Tin,  thickness, 0·005 m.m., Copper,  thickness, 0·05  m.m., Brass,  thickness, 0·005 m.m., Brass,  thickness, 0·005 m.m., Platinum,  thickness, 0·01  m.m., Zinc,  thickness, 0·05  m.m., Lead,  thickness, 0·1   m.m., The system lead-aluminium was slightly more opaque, than the system aluminium-lead,  but the difference was not, great., Thus,  I was unable to discover an appreciable transformation, of the rays of radium. However,  in various radiographic, experiments,  M. Becquerel observed very intense, effects due to scattered or secondary rays,  emitted by solid, screens which received radium rays. Lead seemed to be, the most active substance in this respect., Ionising Action of Radium Rays on Insulating Liquids., M. Curie has pointed out that radium rays and Röntgen, rays act upon liquid dielectrics as upon air,  imparting to, them a certain electrical conductivity. The experiment, was carried out in the following manner (Fig. 9):—, The experimental liquid is placed in a metal vessel, C D E F,  into which a thin copper tube, A B,  is plunged;, these two pieces of metal serve as electrodes. The outer, vessel is maintained at a known potential,  by means of a, battery of small accumulators,  one pole of which is connected, to earth. The tube, A B,  is connected to the electrometer., When a current traverses the liquid the electrometer, is kept at zero by means of a quartz electrical, piezometer,  which gives the strength of the current. The, copper tube, M N M′ N′,  connected to earth,  serves as a, guard tube,  preventing the passage of the current through, the air. A bulb containing the radium-barium salt may be, placed at the bottom of the tube, A B, ; the rays act on the, 59, liquid after having penetrated the glass of the bulb and the, sides of the metal tube. The radium may also be allowed, to act by placing the bulb beneath the side, D E, ., In working with Röntgen rays the course of the rays is, through side, D E, ., The increase of conductivity by the action of the radium, rays or the Röntgen rays seems to be produced in the case, of all liquid dielectrics; but in order to determine this increase, the conductivity of the liquid itself must be so slight, as not to mask the effect of the rays., M. Curie obtained results of the same order of magnitude, with both radium rays and Röntgen rays., When investigating with the same apparatus the conductivity, of air or of another gas under the action of the, Becquerel rays,  the intensity of, the current obtained is found to, be proportional to the difference of, potential between the electrodes, as long as the latter does not, exceed a few volts; but at higher, tensions,  the intensity of the, current increases less and less, rapidly,  and the saturation current, is practically attained for a, tension of 100 volts., Liquids examined with the, same apparatus and the same, radio-active body behave differently;, the intensity of the current, is proportional to the tension, when the latter varies between 0, and 450 volts,  and when the distance, between the electrodes does, not exceed 6 m.m., Fig. 9., The figures of the following table multiplied by 10, –11, give the conductivity in megohms per c.c.:—, Carbon bisulphide, 20, Petroleum ether, 15, Amylene, 14, Benzine, 4, Liquid air, 1·3, Vaseline oil, 1·6, We may,  however,  assume that liquids and gases behave, similarly,  but that,  in the case of liquids,  the current remains, proportional to the tension up to a much higher limit, 60, than in the case of gases. It therefore seemed probable, that the limit of proportionality could be lowered by using, a much more feeble radiation,  and this idea was verified by, experiment. The radio-active body employed was 150, times less active than that which had served for the previous, experiments. For tensions of 50,  100,  200,  400 volts,  the, intensities of the current were represented respectively by, the numbers 109,  185,  255,  335. The proportionality was, no longer maintained,  but the current showed great, variation when the difference of potential was doubled., Some of the liquids examined are nearly perfect insulators, when maintained at a constant temperature and, when screened from the action of the rays. Such are, liquid air,  petroleum ether,  vaseline oil,  and amylene. It, is therefore very easy to study the effect of the rays., Vaseline oil is much less sensitive to the action of the rays, than is petroleum ether. This fact may have some relation, to the difference in volatility which exists between these, two hydrocarbons. Liquid air,  which has boiled for some, time in the experimental vessel,  is more sensitive to the, action of the rays than that newly poured in; the conductivity, produced by the rays is one-fourth as great again, in the former case. M. Curie has investigated the action, of the rays upon amylene and upon petroleum ether at, temperatures of +10° and –17°. The conductivity due to, the radiation diminishes by one-tenth of its value only,  in, passing from 10° to –17°., In the experiments in which the temperature of the, liquid is varied,  the temperature of the radium may be, either that of the surrounding atmosphere or that of the, liquid; the same result is obtained in both cases. This, leads to the conclusion that the radiation of radium does, not vary with the temperature,  and remains unaltered even, at the temperature of liquid air. This fact has been verified, directly by measurements., Various Effects and Applications of the Ionising Action of the Rays Emitted by Radio-active Substances., The rays of the new radio-active substances have a, strongly ionising action upon air. By the action of radium, the condensation of supersaturated water vapour, can be easily, induced,  just as happens by the action of cathode rays, and Röntgen rays., Under the influence of the rays emitted by the new radio-active, substances, the distance of discharge between two, metallic conductors for a given difference of potential is, 61, increased, ; to put it otherwise,  the passage of the spark, is facilitated by these rays., In causing conductivity,  by the action of radio-active, bodies,  in the air in the neighbourhood of two metallic conductors, one of which is connected to earth and the other to, a well-insulated electrometer,  the electrometer is seen to be, permanently deflected,  which gives a measure of the, electromotive force of the battery formed by the air and the, two metals (electromotive force of contact of the two, metals,  when they are separated by air). This method of, measurement was employed by Lord Kelvin and his, students,  the radiating body being uranium; a similar, method had been previously employed by M. Perrin,  who, was using the ionising action of Röntgen rays., Radio-active bodies may be employed in the study of, atmospheric electricity. The active substance is enclosed, in a little box of thin aluminium fixed at the extremity of a, metal wire connected with the electrometer. The air is, made to conduct in the neighbourhood of the end of the, wire,  and the latter adopts the potential of the surrounding, air. Radium thus replaces,  with advantage,  the flames or, the apparatus of running water of Lord Kelvin,  till now in, general use for the investigation of atmospheric electricity., Fluorescent and Luminous Effects., The rays emitted by the new radio-active bodies cause, fluorescence of certain substances. M. Curie and myself, first discovered this phenomenon when causing polonium, to act upon a layer of barium platinocyanide through, aluminium foil. The same experiment succeeds yet more, easily with barium containing radium. When the substance, is strongly radio-active the fluorescence produced is, very beautiful., A large number of bodies are capable of becoming, phosphorescent or fluorescent by the action of the Becquerel, rays. M. Becquerel studied the effect upon the uranium, salts,  the diamond,  &c. M. Bary has demonstrated that, the salts of the metals of the alkalis and alkaline earths, which are all fluorescent under the action of luminous rays, and Röntgen rays,  are also fluorescent under the action of, the rays of radium. Paper,  cotton,  glass,  &c.,  are all, caused to fluoresce in the neighbourhood of radium., Among the different kinds of glass,  Thuringian glass is, specially luminous. Metals do not seem to become, luminous., Barium platinocyanide is most conveniently used when, 62, the radiation of the radio-active bodies is to be investigated, by the fluoroscopic method. The effect of the radium rays, may be followed at distances greater than 2 m. Phosphorescent, zinc sulphide is made extremely luminous,  but, this body has the inconvenient property of preserving its, luminosity for some time after the action of the rays has, ceased., The fluorescence produced by radium may be observed, when the fluorescent screen is separated from the radium, by absorbent screens. We were able to observe the, illumination of a screen of barium platinocyanide across, the human body. However,  the action is incomparably, greater when the screen is placed immediately in contact, with the radium,  being separated from it by no solid screen, at all. All the groups of rays appear capable of producing, fluorescence., In order to observe the action of polonium,  the substance, must be placed close to the fluorescent screen,  without the, intervention of a solid screen,  unless the latter be extremely, thin., The luminosity of fluorescent substances exposed to the, action of radio-active bodies diminishes with time. At the, same time the fluorescent substance undergoes a transformation., The following are examples:—, Radium rays transform barium platinocyanide into a, brown,  less luminous variety (an action similar to that, produced by Röntgen rays,  and described by M. Villard)., Uranium sulphate and potassium sulphate are similarly, altered. The changed barium platinocyanide is partially, regenerated by the action of light. If the radium be placed, beneath a layer of barium platinocyanide spread on paper, the platinocyanide becomes luminous; if the system be kept, in the dark,  the platinocyanide becomes changed,  and its, luminosity diminishes considerably. But if the whole be, exposed to light,  the platinocyanide is partially regenerated, and if the whole is replaced in darkness the luminosity reappears, with vigour. By means of a fluorescent body and, a radio-active body,  we have therefore obtained a system, which acts as a phosphorescent body capable of long duration, of phosphorescence., Glass made fluorescent by the action of radium becomes, coloured brown or violet. At the same time its fluorescence, diminishes. If the glass thus changed be warmed,  it is, decolorised,  and when this occurs the glass becomes, luminous. The glass has now regained its fluorescent, property in the same degree as before the transformation., 63, Zinc sulphide,  which has been exposed for a sufficient, length of time to the action of radium,  gradually becomes, used up,  and loses its phosphorescent property,  whether, under the action of radium or that of light., The diamond becomes phosphorescent under the action, of radium,  and may thus be distinguished from paste, imitations,  which have only a very faint luminosity., All the barium-radium compounds, are spontaneously, luminous, . The dry anhydrous halogen salts emit a particularly, intense light. This illumination cannot be seen, in broad daylight,  but it is easily visible in the twilight or, by gas-light. The light emitted may be strong enough to, read by in the dark. The light emitted emanates from the, entire body of the product,  whilst in the case of a common, phosphorescent body,  the light emanates specially from, the portion of the surface illuminated. Radium products, lose much of their luminosity in damp air,  but they regain, it on drying (Giesel). There is apparently conservation of, luminosity. After many years no sensible modification is, produced in the luminosity of feebly active products,  kept, in the dark in sealed tubes. In the case of very active and, very luminous radium-barium chloride,  the light changes, colour after several months; it becomes more violet and, loses in intensity; at the same time the product undergoes, transformations; on re-dissolving the salt in water, and drying it afresh,  the original luminosity is restored., Solutions of barium-radium salts,  which contain a large, proportion of radium,  are equally luminous; this fact may, be observed by placing the solution in a platinum capsule, which not being itself luminous permits of the faint, luminosity of the solution being seen., When a solution of a barium-radium salt contains crystals, deposited in it,  these crystals are luminous at the bottom of, the solution,  and much more so than the solution itself,  so, that they alone appear luminous., M. Giesel has made a preparation of barium-radium, platinocyanide. When this salt is newly crystallised,  it, has the appearance of ordinary barium platinocyanide, and is very luminous. But gradually the salt becomes, spontaneously coloured,  taking a brown tint,  the crystals at, the same time becoming dichroic. In this state the salt is, much less luminous,  although its radio-activity is increased., The radium platinocyanide,  prepared by M. Giesel,  changes, still more rapidly., Radium compounds are the first example of self-luminous, bodies., 64, Evolution of Heat by the Salts of Radium., MM. Curie and Laborde have recently discovered that, the salts of radium are the source of a spontaneous and continuous, evolution of heat, . This evolution has the effect of, keeping the salts of radium at a temperature higher than, that of their surroundings; an excess of temperature of, 1·5° has been observed. This excess of temperature is, dependent upon the thermal insulation of the body. MM., Curie and Laborde have determined the amount of heat, produced in the case of radium. They found that the output, is of the order of magnitude of 100 calories per grm. of, radium per hour. One grm.-atom (225 grm.) of radium, give rise in one hour to 22, 500 cal.,  a quantity of heat, comparable to that produced by the combustion of 1 grm.-atom, (1 grm.) of hydrogen. So great an evolution of heat, can be explained by no ordinary chemical reaction,  more, particularly as the condition of the radium remains unaffected, for years. The evolution of heat might be attributed, to a slow transformation of the radium atom. If this were, the case,  we should be led to conclude that the quantities, of energy generated during the formation and transformation, of the atoms are considerable,  and that they, exceed all that is so far known., Chemical Effects produced by the New Radio-active Bodies., Colourations., —The radiations of strongly radio-active, bodies are capable of causing certain chemical reactions., The rays emitted by radium products exercise colouring, actions upon glass and porcelain., The colouration of glass,  generally brown or violet,  is, very deep; it is produced in the body of the glass,  and, remains after removal of the radium. All glasses become, coloured after a longer or a shorter interval of time,  and the, presence of lead is not essential. This fact may be compared, to that recently observed of the colouration of the, glass of vacuum tubes,  after having been long in use for the, production of Röntgen rays., M. Giesel has demonstrated that the crystallised halogen, salts of the alkali metals become coloured under the influence, of radium,  as under the action of cathode rays. M., Giesel points out that similar colourations are obtained, when the salts of the alkalis are exposed to sodium vapour., I investigated the colouration of a collection of glasses, of known composition,  kindly lent me for the occasion, by M. Le Chatelier. I observed no great variety in the, colouration. It is generally brown,  violet,  yellow,  or grey., 65, It appears to be associated with the presence of the alkali, metals., With the pure crystallised alkali salts more varied and, more vivid colours are obtained; the salt,  originally white, becomes blue,  green,  yellow,  brown,  &c., M. Becquerel has discovered that yellow phosphorus is, transformed into the red variety by the action of radium., Paper is changed and coloured by the action of radium., It becomes brittle,  scorched,  and,  finally,  resembles a, colander perforated with holes., Under some circumstances there is a production of ozone, in the neighbourhood of very active compounds. Rays, emerging from a sealed jar containing radium do not produce, ozone in the air they pass through. On the contrary, a strong odour of ozone is detected when the jar is opened., In a general way,  ozone is produced in the air when the, latter is in direct contact with the radium. Communication, by a channel,  even if extremely narrow,  suffices; it, appears as if the production of ozone is associated with the, propagation of induced radio-activity,  of which we shall, speak later., Radium compounds appear to change with lapse of time, doubtless under the action of their own radiation. It was, seen above that crystals of barium-radium chloride,  which, are colourless when formed,  become gradually coloured, first yellow or orange,  then pink; this colouration disappears, in solution. Barium-radium chloride generates, oxygen compounds of chlorine; the bromide those of, bromine. These slow changes generally manifest themselves, some time after the preparation of the solid product, which at the same time changes in form and colour, becoming yellow or violet. The light emitted also becomes, more violet., A solution of a radium salt evolves hydrogen (Giesel)., Pure radium salts seem to undergo the same changes, as those containing barium. However,  crystals of the, chloride,  deposited in acid solution,  do not become sensibly, coloured after some time has elapsed,  whereas crystals of, barium-radium chloride,  rich in radium,  become deeply, coloured., Production of Thermo-luminosity., —Certain bodies,  such, as fluorite,  become luminous when heated; they are, thermo-luminescent. Their luminosity disappears after, some time,  but the capacity of becoming luminous afresh, through heat is restored to them by the action of a spark, and also by the action of radium. Radium can thus restore, 66, to these bodies their thermo-luminescent property. Fluorite, when heated undergoes a change,  which is accompanied by, the emission of light. If the fluorite is afterwards subjected, to the action of radium,  an inverse change occurs,  which is, also accompanied by an emission of light., An absolutely similar phenomenon occurs when glass is, exposed to radium rays. Here also a change is produced, in the glass while luminous from the effect of the radium, rays; this change shows itself in the colouration which, appears and gradually increases. If the glass is afterwards, heated,  the inverse change takes place,  the colour disappears, and this phenomenon is accompanied by production, of light. It appears very probable that we have, here a change of a chemical nature,  and the production of, light is associated with this change. This phenomenon may, be general. It might be that the production of fluorescence, by the action of radium and the luminosity of radium compounds, is of necessity associated with some chemical or, physical change in the substance emitting the light., Radiographs., —The radiographic action of the new radio-active, bodies is very marked. However,  the method of, operating should be very different with polonium and, radium. Polonium acts only at very short distances,  and, its action is considerably weakened by solid screens; it is, practically annihilated by means of a screen of slight thickness, (1 m.m. of glass). Radium acts at considerably, greater distances. The radiographic action of radium rays, may be observed at more than 2 m. distance in air,  even, when the active product is enclosed in a glass vessel. The, rays acting under these conditions belong to the β- and, γ-groups. Owing to the differences in transparency of, different materials to the rays,  radiographs of different, objects may be obtained,  as in the case of Röntgen rays., Metals are,  as a rule,  opaque,  with the exception of, aluminium,  which is very transparent. There is no noteworthy, difference of transparency between flesh and bone., The operation may be carried on at a great distance and, with a source of very small dimensions; and very delicate, radiographs are thus produced. The beauty of the radiograph, is enhanced by deflecting to one side the β-rays, by means of a magnetic field,  and utilising only the γ-rays., The β-rays,  in traversing the object to be radiographed, undergo a certain amount of diffusion,  and thus cause a, slight fog. In suppressing them,  a longer time of exposure, is necessary,  but better results are obtained. The radiograph, of an object,  such as a purse,  requires one day with a, 67, radiating source composed of several centigrams of a radium, salt,  enclosed in a glass vessel,  and placed at a distance of, 1 m. from the sensitive plate,  in front of which the object is, placed. If the source is at a distance of 20 c.m. from the, plate,  the same result is obtained in one hour. In the, immediate vicinity of the source of radiation,  a sensitive, plate is instantaneously acted upon., Physiological Effects., Radium rays exert an action upon the epidermis. This, has been observed by M. Walkhoff and confirmed by, M. Giesel,  since also by MM. Becquerel and Curie., If a celluloid or thin indiarubber capsule containing a very, active salt of radium be placed upon the skin,  and be left, thus for some time,  a redness is produced upon the skin, either immediately or at the end of some time,  which is, longer in proportion as the action is weaker; this red spot, appears in the place which has been exposed to the action;, the local change in the skin appears and acts like a burn., In certain cases a blister is formed. If the exposure was of, long duration,  an ulceration is produced which is long in, healing. In one experiment,  M. Curie caused a relatively, weak radio-active product to act upon his arm for ten hours., The redness appeared immediately,  and later a wound was, caused which took four months to heal. The epidermis, was locally destroyed,  and formed again slowly and with, difficulty,  leaving a very marked scar. A radium burn with, half-an-hour’s exposure appeared after fifteen days,  formed, a blister and healed in fifteen days. Another burn,  caused, by an exposure of only eight minutes,  occasioned a red spot, which appeared two months after,  its effect being quite, insignificant., The action of radium upon the skin can take place across, metal screens,  but with weakened effect., The action of radium upon the skin has been investigated, by Dr. Daulos,  at the Hospital of St. Louis,  as a process of, treating certain affections of the skin,  similar to the treatment, with the Röntgen rays or the ultra-violet rays. In, this respect radium gives encouraging results; the epidermis, partially destroyed by the action of the radium is renewed, in a healthy condition. The action of radium is more, penetrating than that of light,  and its use is easier than that, of light or of Röntgen rays. The study of the conditions, of application is of necessity rather lengthy,  because the, effect of the application does not at once appear., M. Giesel has observed the action of radium upon plant, 68, leaves. The leaves thus treated turn yellow and wither, away., M. Giesel has also discovered the action of radium rays, upon the eye. If a radio-active substance be placed in the, dark in the vicinity of the closed eye or of the temple, a sensation of light fills the eye. This phenomenon has been, studied by MM. Himstedt and Nagel. These physicists, have demonstrated that the centre of the eye is rendered, fluorescent by the action of radium,  and this explains the, sensation of light experienced. Blind people whose retina, is intact are sensitive to the action of radium,  whilst those, whose retina is diseased do not experience any sensation of, luminosity., Radium rays either arrest or hinder the development of, colonies of microbes,  but this action is not very intense., M. Danysz has recently demonstrated the ready action, of radium upon the marrow and brain. After one hour’s, exposure paralysis of the animals experimented upon, occurred,  and the latter usually died in a few days., Influence of Temperature upon Radiation., There is so far but little information regarding the, manner of variation of the radiation of radio-active bodies, with temperature. We know,  however,  that radiation, subsists at low temperatures. M. Curie placed a glass tube, containing barium-radium chloride in liquid air. The, luminosity of the radio-active body persisted under these, conditions. At the moment,  indeed,  of removing the tube, from the cold bath,  it appears more luminous than at the, ordinary temperature. At the temperature of liquid air, radium continues to cause fluorescence in the sulphates of, uranium and potassium. M. Curie has verified,  by electrical, determinations,  that the radiation,  measured at a certain, distance from the source,  possesses the same intensity, whether the radium be at the temperature of the atmosphere, or of liquid air. In these experiments the radium was, placed at the bottom of a tube closed at one end. The, rays emerged from the tube at the open end,  traversed a, certain space in the air,  and were received into a condenser., The action of the rays upon the air of the condenser was, determined both on leaving the tube in the air and on surrounding, it to a certain height with liquid air. The same, result was obtained in both cases., The radio-activity of radium persists at high temperatures., Barium-radium chloride after being fused (towards 800°) is, radio-active and luminous. However,  prolonged heating at, 69, a high temperature has the effect of temporarily lowering, the radio-activity of the body. This decrease is very considerable;, it may constitute 75 per cent of the total radiation., The decrease is less in proportion for the absorbable, rays than for the penetrating rays,  which are to some, extent suppressed by heating. In time the radiation of the, product regains the intensity and composition that it, possessed before heating; this occurs after the lapse of, about two months from the occasion of heating., CHAPTER IV., Communication of Radio-activity to Substances Initially Inactive., During the course of our researches on radio-active substances, M. Curie and I have observed that every substance, which remains for some time in the vicinity of a radium salt, becomes itself radio-active. In our first publication on this, subject,  we confined ourselves to proving that the radio-activity, thus acquired by substances initially inactive is not, due to the transference of radio-active particles to the, surface of these substances. This is proved beyond dispute by, all the experiments which will be here described,  and by the, laws according to which the radio-activity excited in, naturally inactive bodies disappears when the latter are, removed from the influence of radium., We have given the name of, induced radio-activity, to the, new phenomenon thus discovered., In the same publication,  we indicated the essential, characteristics of induced radio-activity. We excited, screens of different substances by placing them in the, neighbourhood of solid radium salts,  and we investigated, the radio-activity of these screens by the electrical method., We observed the following facts:—, 1. The activity of a screen exposed to the action of, radium increases with the time of exposure,  approaching to, a definite limit according to an asymptotic law., 2. The activity of a screen which has been excited by the, action of radium,  and which is afterwards withdrawn from, its action,  disappears in a few days. This induced activity, approaches zero as a function of the time,  following an, asymptotic law., 3. Other things being equal,  the radio-activity induced, by the same radium product upon different screens is independent, of the nature of the screen. Glass,  paper, metals,  all acquire the same degree of activity., 70, 4. The radio-activity induced in one screen by differing, radium products has a limiting value which rises with the, increased activity of the product., Shortly afterwards,  Mr. Rutherford published a research, which showed that compounds of thorium are capable of, producing the phenomenon of induced radio-activity. Mr., Rutherford discovered for this phenomenon the same laws as, those just enunciated,  besides this additional important fact, that bodies charged with negative electricity become more, active than others. Mr. Rutherford also observed that air, passed over thorium oxide preserves a notable conductivity, for about ten minutes. Air in this condition communicates, induced radio-activity to inactive substances,  especially to, those negatively charged. Mr. Rutherford explains his experiences, by the supposition that compounds of thorium, particularly the oxide,  give rise to a, radio-active emanation, capable of being carried by air currents and charged with, positive electricity. This emanation would be the origin, of induced radio-activity. M. Dorn has repeated,  with, salts of barium containing radium,  the experiments of Mr., Rutherford with thorium oxide., M. Debierne has shown that actinium causes,  to a, marked degree,  induced activity of bodies placed in its, vicinity. As in the case of thorium,  there is a considerable, carriage of activity by air currents., Induced radio-activity has various aspects,  and irregular, results are obtained when the activity of a substance in the, neighbourhood of radium is excited in free air. MM. Curie, and Debierne have observed,  however,  that the phenomenon, is quite regular when operating in a closed vessel; they, therefore investigated induced activity in a closed space., Activity Induced in an Enclosed Space., The active material is placed in a little glass jar, a,  open, at, O, (Fig. 11),  in the centre of a closed space. Several, plates, A, B, C, D, E,  placed in the enclosure become radio-active, after one day’s exposure. The activity is the same, whatever be the nature of the plate,  for equal dimensions, (lead,  copper,  aluminium,  glass,  ebonite,  wax,  cardboard, paraffin). The activity of one face of one of the plates is, greater in proportion to the amount of free space about this, face., If the preceding experiment be repeated with the jar, a, completely closed,  no activity is induced., The radiation of radium does not directly affect the production, of induced radio-activity. For this reason,  in the, 71, preceding experiment the plate, D,  screened from the radiation, by a lead plate of thickness, P P,  is made as active as, B, and, E, ., Radio-activity is transmitted by the air by degrees from, the radiating body to the body to be excited. It can even, be transmitted to a distance by very narrow capillary tubes., Induced radio-activity is both, more intense and more regular, if the solid radium salt be replaced, by an aqueous solution, of the same., Liquids are capable of acquiring, induced radio-activity., For example,  pure water may, be rendered active by placing, it with a solution of a radium, salt within an enclosure., Fig. 11, Certain substances become, luminous when placed in an active enclosure (phosphorescent, and fluorescent bodies,  glass,  paper,  cotton,  water, salt solutions). Phosphorescent zinc sulphide is particularly, brilliant under the circumstances. The radio-activity of, these luminous bodies is,  however,  the same as that of a, piece of a metal or other body which is excited under the, same conditions without becoming luminous., Whatever be the substance made active in a closed vessel, this substance acquires an activity which increases with, length of time until it attains a, limiting value,  always the, same,  for the same material and the same experimental, arrangement., The limit of induced radio-activity is independent of the nature, and pressure of the gas inside the active enclosure, (air,  hydrogen, carbonic acid)., The limit of induced radio-activity for the same enclosure, depends only on the quantity of radium present, in the state of, solution,  and is apparently proportional to it., Part played by Gases in the Phenomena of Induced Radio-activity., Emanation., —The gases present in an enclosure containing, a solid salt or a solution of a salt of radium are radio-active., This radio-activity persists when the gas is drawn off with a, tube and collected in a test-tube. The sides of the test-tube, become themselves radio-active,  and the glass of the test-tube, is luminous in the dark. The activity and luminosity, of the test-tube finally completely disappear,  but very, 72, gradually,  and a month afterwards radio-activity may still, be detected., Since the beginning of our researches,  M. Curie and I, have,  by heating pitchblende,  extracted a strongly radio-active, gas,  but,  as in the preceding experiment,  the activity, of this gas finally completely vanished., We could discern no new ray in the spectrum of this gas;, this was therefore not a case of a new radio-active gas,  and, we understood later that it was the phenomenon of induced, radio-activity., Thus,  for thorium,  radium,  and actinium induced radio-activity, is progressively propagated through the gases,  from, the radiating body to the walls of the enclosure containing, it,  and the exciting principle is carried away with the gas, itself,  when the latter is extracted from the enclosure., When the radio-activity of radium compounds is measured, by the electrical method by means of the apparatus of, Fig. 1,  the air between the plates is itself radio-active;, however,  on passing a current of air between the plates, there is no observable lowering of the intensity of the, current,  which proves that the radio-activity distributed in, the space between the plates is of little account in comparison, with that of the radium itself in the solid state., It is quite otherwise with thorium. The irregularities, which I observed in determining the radio-activity of the, thorium compounds arose from the fact that at this point I, was working with a condenser open to the air; the least air, current caused a considerable change in the intensity of the, current,  because the radio-activity dispersed in the space in, the vicinity of the thorium is considerable as compared with, the radio-activity of the substance., This effect is still more marked in the case of actinium., A very active compound of actinium appears much less, active when a current of air is passed over the substance., The radio-active energy is therefore contained in the gas, in a special form. Mr. Rutherford suggests that radio-active, bodies generate an, emanation, or gaseous material, which carries the radio-activity. In the opinion of M. Curie, and myself,  the generation of a gas by radium is a supposition, which is not so far justified. We consider the, emanation as radio-active energy stored up in the gas in a, form hitherto unknown., Dissipation in Free Air of the Induced Activity of Solid Bodies., A solid body,  which has been excited by radium in an, enclosed space for a sufficient length of time,  and which has, 73, then been removed from the enclosure,  parts with its activity, in free air according to an exponential law,  which is the, same for all bodies represented by the following formula:—, I, 0, being the initial intensity of the radiation at the moment, of withdrawing the plate from the enclosure; I,  the intensity, after time, t, ;, a, is a numerical coefficient,  a = 4·20; θ, 1, and θ, 2, are time constants,  θ, 1, = 2420 secs.,  θ, 2, = 1860 secs., After two or three hours this law becomes practically a, simple exponential,  and the effect of the second exponential, upon the value of I is negligible. The law of dissipation is, therefore such that the intensity of radiation becomes, diminished to one-half its value in twenty-eight minutes., This final law may be considered as characteristic for the, dissipation in an unconfined air space of the activity induced, in solid bodies by radium., Solid bodies excited by actinium lose their activity in the, open air,  according to an exponential law similar to the, preceding,  the dissipation being,  however,  rather slower., Solid bodies,  made active by thorium,  lose their activity, much more slowly; the intensity of the radiation is reduced, to one-half in eleven hours., Dissipation of Activity in a Confined Space. Velocity of Destruction of the Emanation., An enclosure,  made active by radium and then removed, from its influence,  loses its activity by a law which is much, less rapid than that of dissipation in the open air. The, experiment may be carried out with a glass tube,  rendered, active internally by placing it for some time in contact with, a solution of a salt of radium. The tube is then sealed in, the flame,  and the intensity of radiation emitted by the walls, of the tube is measured while the dissipation takes place., The law of dissipation is an exponential law. It is given, very accurately by the formula., I, 0, = initial intensity of radiation., I, = intensity of radiation at time, t, ., θ, = a time constant,  θ = 4·970 × 10, 5, secs., The intensity of the radiation is reduced to one-half in, four days., This law of dissipation is absolutely invariable whatever, be the experimental conditions (dimensions of enclosure, nature of the walls,  nature of the gas within the enclosure, 74, duration of action,  &c.). The law of dissipation remains, the same for any temperature between –180° and +450°., The law is therefore altogether characteristic., In these experiments it is the radio-active energy, accumulated in the gas that maintains the activity of the, walls. If the gas be withdrawn and a vacuum caused in the, enclosure,  we have found that dissipation of activity at once, occurs in the rapid method; the intensity of radiation being, reduced to one-half in twenty-eight minutes. The same, result is obtained when ordinary air is substituted for the, active air in the enclosure., The law of dissipation with reduction of intensity of, radiation to one-half in four days,  is therefore characteristic, of the disappearance of radio-active energy accumulated in, the gas. By making use of the expression adopted by Mr., Rutherford,  the emanation from radium may be said to disappear, spontaneously as a function of the time,  with reduction, to one-half in four days., The emanation from thorium is of another kind,  and disappears, much more rapidly. The intensity of radiation, diminishes to one-half in about one minute ten seconds., The emanation from actinium disappears still more, rapidly; reduction to one-half takes place in a few seconds., Variation of Activity of Liquids rendered Active and of Radium Solutions., Any liquid whatever becomes radio-active when placed in, an active confined space. On being removed and left freely, exposed to the air,  the liquid rapidly loses its activity,  imparting, it to the gas and solid bodies surrounding it. If a, liquid thus made active be placed in a closed flask,  it loses, its activity much more slowly; the latter being reduced in, intensity to one-half in four days,  just as would a gas under, similar circumstances. This fact may be explained by, assuming that the radio-active energy is stored in liquids in, exactly the same form as in gases (in the form of an emanation)., A solution of a radium salt behaves in a somewhat, similar manner. At first,  it is a remarkable fact that the, solution of a radium salt placed for some time in a confined, space is no more active than pure water placed in a vessel, in the same enclosure,  when the equilibrium of activity is, established. If the radium solution be removed from the, enclosure and left standing in the air in a wide-necked, vessel,  the activity spreads itself into space,  and the solution, becomes nearly inactive,  though still containing radium., 75, If this solution be now enclosed in a stoppered flask,  it, gradually regains,  in about a fortnight,  a maximum of, activity,  which may be considerable. On the other hand,  a, liquid made active,  but not containing radium,  does not regain, its activity in a closed flask after having been exposed, to the atmosphere., Theory of Radio-activity., The following is,  according to MM. Curie and Debierne, a very general theory which allows of the co-ordination of, the results of the investigation of induced radio-activity, which results I have just stated,  and which constitute facts, apart from any hypothesis., It may be said that each atom of radium acts as a constant, and continuous source of energy,  without actually, defining the origin of this energy. The radio-active energy, which accumulates in the radium tends to become dissipated, in two different ways:—(1) By radiation (rays both charged, and uncharged with electricity); (2) by conduction, i.e.,  by, gradual transmission to surrounding bodies in a medium of, gases and liquids (production of an emanation and transformation, into induced radio-activity)., The loss of radio-active energy,  both by radiation and by, conduction,  increases with the amount of energy accumulated, in the radio-active body. The system is necessarily, in equilibrium when the double loss of which I have just, made mention compensates the constant gain due to the, action of radium. This manner of regarding the subject is, similar to that in use for calorific phenomena. If in the, interior of any body there is,  owing to any cause,  a continuous, and constant evolution of heat,  the heat accumulates, in the body and the temperature rises until the loss of, heat by radiation and conduction is in equilibrium with the, constant gain of heat., In general,  except under certain special circumstances, the activity is not propagated through solid bodies. When, a solution is kept in a sealed tube,  the loss by radiation, alone takes place,  and the radiating activity of the solution, is of a higher degree., If,  on the contrary,  the solution stands in an open vessel, the loss of activity by conduction becomes considerable, and when the state of equilibrium is attained,  the radiating, activity of the solution is very feeble., The radiating activity of a solid radium salt left exposed, to the air does not sensibly diminish,  because the propagation, of activity by conduction not taking place through, solid bodies,  it is a very thin superficial layer only that produces, 76, induced radio-activity. The solution,  however,  of the, same salt produces much more intense phenomena of, induced radio-activity. With a solid salt the radio-active, energy accumulates in the salt,  and is dissipated chiefly by, radiation. On the other hand,  when the salt has been for, several days in aqueous solution,  the radio-active energy is, divided between the salt and the water,  and if separated by, distillation the water carries with it a large portion of the, activity,  and the solid salt is much less active (ten or fifteen, times) than before solution. Afterwards the solid salt, gradually regains its original activity., The preceding theory may be yet further defined by supposing, the radio-activity of radium itself to be produced, through the medium of the radio-active energy emitted in, the form of an emanation., Each atom of radium may be considered as a constant, and continuous source of emanation. At the same moment, that this form of energy is produced,  it undergoes a progressive, transformation into radio-active energy of the, Becquerel radiation. The velocity of this transformation is, proportional to the quantity of the emanation accumulated., When a radium solution is placed within an enclosure, the emanation is able to expand into the enclosure and to, spread out over the walls. Here it is,  therefore,  that it is, transformed into a radiation,  the solution giving off but few, Becquerel rays; the radiation is,  in some sort, externalised, ., On the other hand,  with solid radium,  the emanation not, being able to escape readily,  accumulates,  and is transformed, into the Becquerel radiation on the spot; this radiation, therefore acquires a higher value., If this theory of radio-activity were general,  we should, have to say that all radio-active bodies give rise to an, emanation. Now this emission has been confirmed in the, case of radium,  thorium,  and actinium; with the latter in, particular the emission is enormous,  even in the solid state., Uranium and polonium do not seem to emit any emanation, though they generate Becquerel rays. These bodies produce, no induced radio-activity in an enclosed space,  as do, the radio-active bodies mentioned before. This fact is not, in absolute contradiction to the preceding theory. If, uranium and polonium were to emit emanations which become, destroyed with very great rapidity,  it would be very, difficult to observe the carriage of such emanations by the, air and the effects of induced radio-activity produced by, them upon neighbouring bodies. Such a hypothesis is not, improbable,  since the times required for certain quantities of, 77, the emanations of radium and thorium to diminish to one-half, are in the proportion of 5000 to 1. We shall see,  moreover, that,  under certain conditions,  uranium can excite, induced activity., Another Form of Induced Radio-activity., According to the law of dissipation in the open air of the, activity induced by radium in solid bodies,  the activity after, one day is almost imperceptible., Certain bodies,  however,  form exceptions; such are, celluloid,  paraffin,  caoutchouc,  &c. When these bodies, have been acted upon to a sufficient degree,  they lose their, activity more slowly than the law can account for,  and it is, often fifteen or twenty days before the activity becomes, imperceptible. These bodies appear to have the property of, becoming charged with radio-active energy in the form of an, emanation; they afterwards lose it gradually,  causing induced, radio-activity in the vicinity., Induced Radio-activity with Slow Dissipation., There is yet another form of induced radio-activity,  which, appears to be produced in all bodies which have been kept, for months in an active enclosure. When these bodies are, removed from the enclosure their activity at first diminishes, to a very low value according to the ordinary law (diminution, to one-half in half-an-hour); but when the activity has, fallen to about 1/20, 000 of the initial value,  it diminishes no, further,  or at least it is dissipated very slowly,  sometimes, even increasing in amount. We have sheets of copper, aluminium,  and glass which still retain a residual activity, after six months., These phenomena of induced radio-activity appear to be, of a different kind from the ordinary ones,  and show a much, slower process of evolution., A considerable time is also necessary both for the production, and dissipation of this form of induced radio-activity., Radio-activity Induced upon Substances in Solution with Radium., When a radio-active ore containing radium is treated, with the object of extracting the radium,  chemical separations, are effected,  after which the radio-activity is confined, entirely to one of the products. In this way active products, which may be several hundred times as active as uranium, are separated from totally inactive products,  such as copper, antimony,  arsenic,  &c. Certain other bodies (iron,  lead), were never separated in an entirely inactive state. As, 78, these active bodies are concentrated,  the case is no longer, the same; each chemical separation no longer furnishes, absolutely inactive products; all the resulting products of a, separation are active in varying degrees., After the discovery of induced radio-activity,  M. Giesel, was the first to attempt to excite activity in ordinary inactive, bismuth by keeping it in solution with very active, radium. He thus obtained radio-active bismuth,  and from, this he concluded that the polonium extracted from pitchblende, was probably bismuth made active by the vicinity of, the radium contained in the pitchblende., I have also prepared active bismuth by keeping bismuth, in solution with a very active radium salt., The difficulties of this experiment consist in the extreme, precautions which must be taken to remove all traces of, radium from the solution. If we realise what an infinitesimal, quantity of radium suffices to produce very considerable, radio-activity in 1 grm. of material,  it is difficult to, believe in the possibility of sufficiently washing and, purifying the active product. Each purification causes a, diminution of activity of the product,  whether this be due to, removal of traces of radium or that the induced radio-activity, is,  under these circumstances,  not proof against chemical, reactions., The results I obtained appear,  however,  to establish with, certainty the fact that the activity is produced and persists, after the radium is removed. On fractionating the nitrate, of my active bismuth by precipitation with water from the, nitric acid solution,  I found that after careful purifying it, fractionated like polonium,  the most active portion being, precipitated first., If the purification is not complete the opposite occurs, showing that traces of radium still remain. I thus obtained, active bismuth which from the manner of fractionation, showed great purity and which was 2000 times as active as, uranium. This bismuth diminishes in activity with lapse, of time. But another portion of the same product,  prepared, with the same precautions,  and fractionating in the same, manner,  preserves its activity without diminution for, actually a period of about three years., This activity is 150 times as great as that of uranium., I have also prepared active lead and silver by leaving, them in solution with radium. Generally induced radio-activity, obtained in this way scarcely lessens with lapse of, time,  but it does not as a rule withstand many successive, chemical changes of the active body., 79, M. Debierne made active barium by placing it in solution, with actinium. This barium remains active after several, chemical reactions,  its activity being therefore a somewhat, stable atomic property. Active barium chloride fractionates, like barium-radium chloride,  the more active portions being, the least soluble in water and dilute hydrochloric acid., The dry chloride is spontaneously luminous: its Becquerel, radiation is similar to that of barium-radium chloride. M., Debierne has prepared an active barium chloride 1000 times, as active as uranium. This barium,  however,  had not, acquired all the characteristics of radium,  for it showed none, of the strongest radium lines in the spectroscope. Further, its activity diminished on standing,  and after three weeks it, had become one-third of its original value., There is a wide field for research upon the radio-activity, induced in substances in solution with active bodies. It, appears that,  according to the conditions of experiment, more or less stable forms of induced atomic radio-activity, may be obtained. The radio-activity induced under these, circumstances is perhaps identical with that form,  which, dissipates slowly,  obtained by prolonged exposure at a distance, in an active enclosure. We have reason to enquire, to what degree induced radio-activity affects the chemical, nature of the atom,  and if it is able to modify the chemical, properties of the latter,  either temporarily or permanently., The chemical investigation of bodies excited at a distance, is rendered difficult by the fact that the induced activity is, limited to a very thin superficial layer,  and that,  consequently, only a very small proportion of the material has, been affected., Induced radio-activity also results from leaving certain, substances in solution with uranium. The experiment, succeeded in the case of barium. If,  as was done by M., Debierne,  sulphuric acid be added to a solution containing, uranium and barium,  the precipitate of barium sulphate, acquires radio-activity,  and,  at the same time,  the uranium, salt loses part of its activity. M. Becquerel found,  after, repeating this experiment several times,  that almost inactive, uranium was obtained. This might lead to the opinion that, a radio-active body differing from uranium had been, separated from the latter,  its presence producing radio-activity, in uranium. This,  however,  is not the case,  for, after some months the uranium regains its original activity;, the precipitated barium sulphate,  on the contrary,  loses, what it acquired., A similar phenomenon is observed with thorium. Mr., 80, Rutherford precipitated a solution of a salt of thorium with, ammonia; he separated off the solution and evaporated it, to dryness. He thus obtained a small very active residue, and the precipitated thorium was observed to be less active, than before. This active residue,  to which Mr. Rutherford, gives the name of, thorium, X,  loses its activity after a time, whilst the thorium regains its original activity., It appears,  then,  that concerning induced radio-activity, all bodies do not behave in a similar manner,  and that, certain of them are much more readily excited than others., Dissemination of Radio-active Particles and Induced Radio-activity of the Laboratory., In making investigations of strongly radio-active bodies, particular precautions must be observed for obtaining, delicate determinations. The different objects used in the, chemical laboratory and those used for physical experiments, soon acquire radio-activity,  and act upon photographic, plates through black paper. Dust particles,  the air of the, room,  clothing,  all become radio-active. The air of the, room becomes a conductor. In our laboratory the evil has, become acute,  and we no longer have any apparatus, properly insulated., Special precautions must therefore be taken to avoid as, much as possible the dissemination of active dust particles, and to avoid also the phenomena of induced activity., The objects employed in chemistry should never be, brought into the room where physical research is carried on, and as far as possible should be avoided any unnecessary, keeping of active substances in this room. Before beginning, our researches we were in the habit,  in the case of, electrical experiments,  of making a connection between the, different parts of the apparatus by insulated metallic wires, protected by metal cylinders connected to earth,  which, screened the wires from all outside electrical forces. In the, investigation of radio-active bodies this arrangement is quite, defective; the air being a conductor there is incomplete, insulation between the thread and the cylinder,  and the, inevitable electromotive force of contact between the thread, and the cylinder tends to produce a current through the air, and to cause a deflection of the electrometer. We now, screen all the wires from the air by placing them inside, cylinders filled with paraffin or other insulating material., It would also be advantageous in these investigations to, make use of carefully enclosed electrometers., 81, Activity Induced Outside the Influence of Radio-active Substances., Attempts were made to produce induced radio-activity, outside the action of radio-active bodies., M. Villard subjected to the action of the cathode rays a, piece of bismuth placed as anticathode in a Crookes tube;, the bismuth was thus rendered active to a very slight, degree,  for it required an exposure of eight days to obtain, a photographic impression., Mr. MacLennan has exposed different salts to the action, of cathode rays,  afterwards warming them slightly. The, salts then acquired the property of neutralising bodies, positively charged., Studies of this kind are of great interest. If,  by using, known physical agents,  it were possible to create a considerable, radio-activity in bodies originally inactive,  we, might hope thence to discover the cause of the spontaneous, radio-activity of certain substances., Variations of Activity of Radio-active Bodies. Effects of Solution., The activity of polonium,  as I have said above,  diminishes, with time. This diminution is slow,  and does not take, place at the same rate with different specimens. A sample, of bismuth-polonium nitrate lost half its activity in eleven, months,  and 95 per cent in thirty-three months. Other, specimens have evidenced similar diminution., A specimen of metallic bismuth containing polonium was, prepared from the nitrite,  its activity after preparation being, 100, 000 times that of uranium. The metal is now only a, body of medium radio-activity (2000 times that of uranium)., Its radio-activity is determined at intervals. In six months, it has lost 67 per cent of its activity., The loss of activity does not seem to be facilitated by, chemical action. In rapid chemical changes no considerable, loss of activity has in general taken place., In contrast to that which occurs with polonium,  radium, salts possess a permanent radio-activity which evidences no, appreciable diminution after many years., A freshly prepared radium salt in the solid state does not, at first possess an activity of constant strength. Its activity, increases from the time of preparation until it attains a, practically constant limiting value after about one month., The opposite is the case for a solution. When freshly prepared, the solution is very active,  but when left exposed to, the air it rapidly loses activity,  and finally reaches a limiting, 82, activity which may be considerably less than the original., These variations of activity were first observed by M., Giesel. They are easily accounted for by the emanation, theory. The diminution of the activity of the solution corresponds, to the loss of the emanation which escapes into, space; this diminution is much less when the solution is contained, in a sealed tube. A solution which has lost its activity, in air recovers a greater activity in a sealed tube. The time of, increase of the activity of the salt which,  after solution,  has, been recently obtained in the solid state,  is that during which, the emanation is being newly stored in the solid radium., The following are some experiments on this subject:—, A solution of barium-radium chloride left exposed to the, air for two days becomes 300 times less active., A solution is enclosed in a stoppered vessel; the vessel, is opened,  the solution poured into a dish,  and the activity, determined:—, Activity immediately determined, 67, Activity after two hours, 20, Activity after two days, 0·25, A solution of barium-radium chloride,  which has been, kept open to the air,  is enclosed in a sealed glass tube,  and, the radiation of this tube determined. The following results, were observed:—, Activity determined immediately, 27, Activity determined after 2 days, 61, Activity determined after 3 days, 70, Activity determined after 4 days, 81, Activity determined after 7 days, 100, Activity determined after 11 days, 100, The initial activity of a solid salt after preparation is, feeble in proportion as the time of solution was long. A, greater proportion of activity is then transmitted to the, solvent. The following figures give the initial activity with, a chloride whose limiting activity is 800,  and which was, kept for a given time in solution; the salt was afterwards, dried,  and its activity immediately determined:—, Limiting activity, 800, Initial activity after solution and immediate evaporation, 440, Initial activity after the salt has remained dissolved 5 days, 120, Initial activity after the salt has remained dissolved 18 days, 130, Initial activity after the salt has remained dissolved 32 days, 114, 83, During this experiment the dissolved salt was placed in a, vessel merely covered with a watch-glass., I made with the same salt two solutions which I kept in, sealed tubes for thirteen months; one of these solutions, was eight times the strength of the other:—, Initial activity of the salt in concentrated solution after evaporation, 200, Initial activity of the salt in dilute solution after evaporation, 100, The loss of activity of the salt is therefore greater when, the amount of solvent is greater,  the radio-active energy, transmitted to the liquid having a greater volume of liquid, to saturate and a greater space to fill. The two specimens, of the same salt,  which thus had a different initial activity, further increased in activity at very different rates at first;, at the end of one day they had the same activity,  and the, increase of activity now continued in the same manner for, both till the limit was reached., When the solution is dilute the loss of activity by the, salt is very rapid,  as is shown by the following experiments:—Three, equal portions of the same radium salt are, dissolved in equal quantities of water. The first solution, (, a, ) is allowed to stand in contact with the air for one hour, and is then evaporated. The second solution (, b, ) has a, current of air passed through it for one hour,  and is then, evaporated. The third solution (, c, ) is left exposed to the air, for thirteen days,  and then evaporated to dryness. The, initial activity of each of the three salts is:—, For portion, a, 145·2, For portion, b, 141·6, For portion, c, 102·6, The limiting activity of the same salt is about 470. We, thus see that the greatest part of the effect was produced, at the end of one hour. Further,  the air current bubbling, through solution, b, for one hour produced little effect. The, proportion of salt in solution was about 0·5 per cent., Radio-active energy in the form of an emanation is, propagated with difficulty from solid radium in air; it, experiences the same resistance to propagation from solid, radium in a liquid. When radium sulphate is shaken with, water for a whole day,  its activity after the operation is, practically the same as that of a portion of the same sulphate, left exposed to air., On placing the radium salt in a vacuum,  all the emanation, capable of displacement is withdrawn. However,  the, 84, radio-activity of a radium chloride kept, in vacuo, for six days, was not sensibly affected by the operation. This experiment, shows that the radio-activity of the salt is principally, due to the radio-active energy generated within the particles, and which is unaffected by the vacuum., The loss of activity that radium undergoes when in solution, is relatively greater for the penetrating rays than for, the absorbable rays. The following are examples of this:—, A radium chloride which had reached its limit of activity, 470,  was dissolved and left in solution for one hour; it was, then evaporated,  and its initial radio-activity determined by, the electrical method. The total initial radiation was, found to be equal to the fraction 0·3 of the total limiting, radiation. If the determination of the intensity of radiation, be made by covering the active body with an aluminium, screen 0·01 m.m. thick,  the initial radiation which traverses, this screen is found to be only the fraction 0·17 of the limiting, radiation traversing the same screen., When the salt has been thirteen days in solution,  the, total initial radiation is found to be the fraction 0·22 of the, total limiting radiation,  and is 0·13 of the limiting radiation, after traversing 0·01 m.m. of aluminium., In the two cases the ratio of the initial radiation after, solution to the limiting radiation is 1·7 times as great for, the total radiation as for the radiation which has traversed, 0·01 m.m. of aluminium., It must further be mentioned that on evaporating the, product after solution,  it is impossible to avoid a certain, period of time during which the product is in an intermediate, condition,  neither entirely solid nor entirely liquid. Neither, can one avoid warming the product to remove the water, quickly., For these two reasons it is scarcely possible to determine, the true initial activity of the product passing from solution, to the solid state. In the experiments just quoted,  equal, quantities of the active bodies were dissolved in the same, quantity of water,  and the solutions were then evaporated, to dryness under conditions as identical as possible,  and, without heating above 120° or 130°., I investigated the law according to which the activity of, a solid radium salt increases,  from the moment in which the, salt is obtained dry after solution to the moment in which it, reaches its limit of activity. In the tables which follow, the intensity of radiation,  I,  is represented as a function of, the time,  the limiting intensity being supposed equal to 100, and the time being reckoned from the moment at which the, 85, product was dried. Table I. (Fig. 12,  Curve I.) refers to, the total radiation. Table II. (Fig. 12,  Curve II.) refers, only to the penetrating rays (rays which have traversed, 3 c.m. of air and 0·01 m.m. of aluminium)., Table I., Table II., Time., Days., I., Time., Days., I., 0, 21, 0, 1·3, 1, 25, 1, 19, 3, 44, 3, 43, 5, 60, 6, 60, 10, 78, 15, 70, 19, 93, 23, 86, 33, 100, 46, 94, 67, 100, Fig. 12., I made several other series of determinations of the same, kind,  but they do not absolutely agree with one another, although the general character of the curves obtained remains, the same. It is difficult to obtain very regular, results. It may,  however,  be remarked that the acquisition, of activity requires more than one month for its production, and that the most penetrating rays are the most deeply, affected by solution., The initial intensity of the radiation which is able to, traverse 3 c.m. of air and 0·01 m.m. of aluminium is only, 1 per cent of the limiting intensity,  whilst the initial intensity, of the total radiation is 21 per cent of the total limiting, radiation., A radium salt which has been dissolved and recently, evaporated to dryness possesses the same power of causing, 86, induced activity (and,  consequently,  of allowing the escape, of an emanation),  as a specimen of the same salt which, after having been prepared in the solid state,  has remained, in this condition long enough to have attained its limiting, radio-activity. The radiant activity of these two products, is,  however,  quite different; the former is,  for example,  five, times less active than the latter., Variations of the Activity of Radium Salts on Heating., When a radium compound is heated,  it gives off an, emanation and loses activity. The more intense and the, more prolonged the heating,  the greater is the loss of, activity. Thus,  on heating a radium salt for one hour to, 130°,  it loses 10 per cent of its total radiation; on the other, hand,  heating for ten minutes to 400° produces no apparent, effect. Heating to redness for several hours destroys 77 per, cent of the total radiation., The loss of activity on heating is more considerable for, the penetrating than for the absorbable rays. Thus,  heating, for several hours destroys about 77 per cent of the total, radiation,  but the same amount of heating destroys nearly, the whole (99 per cent) of the radiation that traverses 3 c.m., of air and 0·01 m.m. of aluminium. If barium-radium chloride, be kept fused for several hours (towards 800°) 98 per cent, of the radiation capable of traversing 0·3 m.m. of aluminium, is destroyed. The penetrating rays may be considered as no, longer in existence after intense and prolonged heating., When a radium salt has lost part of its activity by heating, the diminution is not lasting; the activity of the salt is, spontaneously regenerated at the ordinary temperature,  and, approaches a certain limiting value. I have observed the, curious fact that this limit is higher than the limiting, activity of the salt before being heated—this,  at least,  is, the case with the chloride. I give examples of this:—A, specimen of barium-radium chloride which,  after having, been prepared in the solid state,  has long since attained its, limiting activity,  possesses a total radiation represented by, the number 470,  and a radiation capable of traversing 0·01, m.m. of aluminium,  represented by the number 157. This, specimen is heated to redness for several hours. Two, months after the heating it attains its limit of activity with, a total radiation equal to 690,  and a radiation through, 0·01 m.m. of aluminium,  equal to 227. The total radiation, and the radiation transmitted by aluminium are therefore, increased respectively in the ratios, 690, 470, and, 227, 156, . These, 87, two ratios are practically equal to one another,  and are, equivalent to 1·45., A specimen of radium-barium chloride which,  after having, been prepared in the solid state,  has attained a limiting, activity of 62,  is maintained in a state of fusion for some, hours; the fused product is then powdered. The product, regains a new limiting activity equal to 140,  which is twice, as great as that to which it was able to attain when prepared, in the solid state without having been sensibly heated, during evaporation., I have investigated the law of increase of activity of, radium compounds after heating. The following are the, results of two series of determinations:—The figures of, Table I. and II. represent the intensity of the radiation (I), as a function of time,  the limiting intensity being supposed, equal to 100,  and the time being reckoned from the close of, the heating. Table I. (Fig. 13,  Curve I.) refers to the total, radiation of a specimen of barium-radium chloride. Table, II. (Fig. 13,  Curve II.) relates to the penetrating radiation, of a specimen of barium-radium sulphate,  the intensity of, the radiation which traversed 3 c.m. of air and 0·01 m.m. of, aluminium having been determined. The two products, were subjected to a bright red heat for seven hours., Table I., Table II., Time., Days., I., Time., Days., I., 0, 16·2, 0, 0·8, 0·6, 25·4, 0·7, 13, 1, 27·4, 1, 18, 2, 38, 1·9, 26·4, 3, 46·3, 6, 46·2, 4, 54, 10, 55·5, 6, 67·5, 14, 64, 10, 84, 18, 71·8, 24, 95, 27, 81, 57, 100, 36, 91, 50, 95·5, 57, 99, 84, 100, I made several other series of determinations,  but the, results did not agree well., The effect of heating does not persist when the heated, radium compound is dissolved. Of two specimens of the, same radium compound of activity 1800,  one was strongly, heated and its activity thereby reduced to 670. The two, portions being now dissolved and left in solution for twenty, 88, hours,  their initial activities in the solid state were 460 for, the not heated portion and 420 for the heated one; the, difference between the two portions was therefore not considerable., But if the two products do not remain for a, sufficient length of time in solution—if,  for example,  they, are evaporated to dryness,  immediately after solution—the, not heated product is much more active than the heated, one; a certain time is necessary in the dissolved state for the, effects of heating to disappear. A product of activity 3200, was heated,  and its activity thereby reduced to 1030. This, product and a similar portion which had not been heated, were simultaneously dissolved,  and the two then immediately, evaporated to dryness. The initial activity was 1450, for the not heated portion,  and 760 for the heated one., Fig. 13., In the case of solid radium salts the capacity for exciting, induced radio-activity is largely affected by heating. During, heating radium compounds give off a larger amount of, emanation than at the ordinary temperature; but on being, cooled to the ordinary temperature,  not only is their radio-activity, much less than before heating,  but their capacity, for inducing activity is much diminished. During the time, that follows the heating,  the radio-activity of the product, increases,  and may even exceed the original value. The, induction capacity is also partially re-established; however, after prolonged heating to redness,  this capacity is almost, entirely destroyed without spontaneous re-appearance afterwards., The induction capacity may be restored to the, radium salt by dissolving it in water,  and drying it in the, oven at a temperature of 120°. This seems to have the, 89, effect of leaving the salt in a peculiar physical condition,  in, which the emanation is given off with much less facility, than is the case with the same solid product not heated to, a high temperature,  and it follows naturally that the salt, attains a higher limit of activity than that which it possessed, before heating. To transform the salts into the, physical condition proper to it before heating,  it suffices to, dissolve it and to evaporate it to dryness without heating it, above 150°., The following are numerical examples of the above:—, I represent by, a, the limit of induced activity produced in, a closed vessel upon a plate of copper by a specimen of, barium-radium carbonate of activity 1600., Suppose, a, = 100 for the not heated product. We find—, 1 day after heating, a, =  3·3, 4 days after heating, a, =  7·1, 10 days after heating, a, = 15, 20 days after heating, a, = 15, 37 days after heating, a, = 15, The radio-activity of the product had diminished 90 per, cent by heating,  but one month afterwards the original, value was regained., The following is an experiment of the same kind made, with a barium-radium chloride of activity 3000. The induction, capacity is determined in the same manner as before., For the product not heated, a, = 100., Induction capacity of the product after being heated to, redness for three hours:—, 2 days after heating, 2·3, 5 days after heating, 7·0, 11 days after heating, 8·2, 18 days after heating, 8·2, Induction capacity of the unheated substance which has been dissolved and then dried at 150°, 92, Induction capacity of the heated substance which has been dissolved and then dried at 150°, 105, Theory of Interpretation of the Causes of Variations of Activity of Radium Salts after Solution and after Heating., The facts previously indicated may be in part explained, by the theory according to which the energy of radium is, produced in the form of an emanation,  which is then transformed, into the energy of radiation. When a radium salt, is dissolved,  the emanation produced by it spreads beyond, the solution,  and causes radio-activity outside the source, 90, from which it proceeds; when the solution is evaporated, the solid salt obtained is but slightly active,  because it contains, only a small amount of emanation. Gradually the, emanation is accumulated in the salt,  the activity of which, rises to a limiting value,  which is reached when the production, of the emanation by the radium compensates the, loss by external emission and by local transformation into, Becquerel rays., When a radium salt is heated,  the external emission of, the emanation is greatly increased,  and the phenomena of, induced radio-activity are more intense than when the salt, is at the ordinary temperature. But when the salt returns, to the ordinary temperature it is exhausted,  as is the case, after being dissolved,  and contains but a small amount of, emanation,  its activity having become greatly reduced., Gradually the emanation accumulates afresh in the solid, salt,  and the radiation increases., It may be said that radium gives rise to a constant, generation of any emanation—part of which escapes to the, exterior,  the remainder being transformed in the radium, itself into Becquerel rays. When radium is raised to a red, heat,  it loses the greater part of its capacity to cause the, induction of activity; otherwise stated,  the evolution of the, emanation is lessened. Consequently,  the proportion of, the emanation utilised in the radium itself should be greater, and the substance attains a higher limit of radio-activity., We will endeavour to establish theoretically the law of, rise of activity of a solid radium salt which has been dissolved, or has been heated. We will assume that the intensity, of radiation of radium is,  at each instant,  proportional, to the quantity of emanation, q,  present in the radium., We know that the emanation is spontaneously destroyed, according to a law such that,  at each instant—, q, 0, being the amount of the emanation at the moment of, starting the observation,  and θ the time constant,  equal to, 4·97 × 10, 5, secs., Now let Δ be the evolution of the emanation by radium, a quantity which I will assume constant. Let us consider, what would occur if no emanation were escaping to the exterior., The emanation generated would then be completely, utilised by the radium for the production of the radiation., We have from Formula 1—, 91, and consequently,  in the state of equilibrium,  the radium, would contain a certain quantity of emanation,  Q,  such, that—, and the radiation of the radium would then be proportional, to Q., Let us suppose the radium placed in the circumstances, under which it gives off the emanation to the exterior; this, is obtained by dissolving the radium compound or by heating, it. The equilibrium will be disturbed,  and the activity of, the radium diminished. But as soon as the cause of the, loss of emanation has been abolished (the body being restored, to the solid state or the heating having ceased),  the, emanation is accumulated afresh in the radium and we have, a period during which the evolution,  Δ,  surpasses the, velocity of destruction, q, /θ. We then have—, from which—, (, d, /, dt, )(Q –, q, ) = –(Q –, q, )/θ, Q –, q, = (Q –, q, 0, )e, –, t, /θ, 3, q, 0, being the amount of emanation present in the radium at, time, t, = 0., According to Formula 3,  the excess of the quantity of, emanation,  Q,  contained by the radium in a state of equilibrium, above the quantity, q,  contained at a given moment, decreases as a function of the time according to an exponential, law,  which is also the law of the spontaneous disappearance, of the emanation. The radiation of radium being, proportional to the amount of emanation,  the excess of the, intensity of the limiting radiation above the actual intensity, should decrease as a function of the time by the same law;, the excess should thus diminish to one-half in about four days., The preceding theory is incomplete,  since the loss of, emanation to the exterior has been neglected. It is also, difficult to determine the manner in which this acts as a, function of the time. In comparing the results of experiment, with those of this incomplete theory,  there is found, to be no satisfactory agreement; the conviction is,  however, retained that the theory in question is partially true. The, 92, law by which the excess of limiting activity above the actual, activity diminishes to one-half in four days represents, approximately the course of the renewal of activity after, heating for ten days. In the case of the renewal of activity, after solution,  the same law appears to hold approximately, for a certain period of time,  which begins two or three days, after evaporation to dryness and continues for ten or fifteen, days. The phenomena are otherwise complex; the theory, sketched out does not explain the reason of the suppression, of the penetrating rays in greater proportion than the absorbable, rays., Nature and Cause of the Phenomena of Radio-activity., From the beginning of research upon the radio-active, bodies,  and when the properties of these bodies were yet, hardly known,  the spontaneity of their radiation presented, itself as a problem having the greatest interest for physicists., To-day we have advanced considerably in the understanding, of radio-active bodies,  and are able to isolate one of very, great power,  viz.,  radium. With the object of making use, of the remarkable properties of radium,  a profound investigation, of the rays emitted by radio-active bodies is indispensable;, the various groups of rays under investigation, present points of similarity with the groups of rays existing, in Crookes tubes: cathode rays,  Röntgen rays,  canal rays., The same groups of rays are found in the secondary radiation, produced by Röntgen rays,  and in the radiation of, bodies which have acquired radio-activity by induction., But if the nature of the radiation is actually better known, the cause of this spontaneous radiation remains a mystery, and the phenomena always presents itself to us as a profound, and wonderful enigma., The spontaneously radio-active bodies,  and in the first, place radium,  are sources of energy. The evolution of, energy,  to which they give rise,  is manifested by Becquerel, radiation,  by chemical and luminous effects,  and by the continuous, generation of heat., The question often arises as to whether energy is created, within the radio-active bodies themselves,  or whether it is, borrowed by them from external sources. No one of the, numerous hypotheses arising from these two points of view, has yet received experimental confirmation., The radio-active energy may be assumed to have been, initially accumulated and then gradually dissipated,  as, 93, happens in the case of long continued phosphorescence., We imagine the evolution of radio-active energy to correspond, to a transformation of the nature of the atom of, the active body; the fact of the continuous generation of, heat by radium speaks in favour of this hypothesis. The, transformation may be assumed to be accompanied by a, loss of weight and by an emission of material particles constituting, the radiation. The source of energy may yet be, sought in the energy of gravitation. Finally,  we may, imagine that space is constantly traversed by radiations yet, unknown,  which are arrested in their course by radio-active, bodies and transformed into radio-active energy., Many reasons are adduced for and against these different, views,  and most often attempts at experimental verifications, of the conclusions drawn from these hypotheses have given, negative results. The radio-active energy of uranium and, radium apparently neither becomes exhausted nor varies, appreciably with lapse of time. Demarçay examined spectroscopically, a specimen of pure radium chloride after a five, months’ interval,  and observed no change in the spectrum., The principal barium line,  which was visible in the spectrum, indicating the presence of a trace of barium,  had not increased, in intensity during the interval,  showing therefore, that there was no transformation of radium into barium to, an appreciable extent., The variations of weight announced by M. Heydweiller, in radium compounds cannot yet be looked upon as established, facts., Elster and Geitel found that the radio-activity of uranium, is not affected at the bottom of a mine-shaft 850 m. deep;, a layer of earth of this thickness would therefore not affect, the hypothetical primary radiation which would be excited, by the radio-activity of uranium., We have determined the radio-activity of uranium at, midday and at midnight,  thinking that if the hypothetical, primary radiation had its origin in the sun it would be, partly absorbed in traversing the earth. The experiment, showed no difference in the two determinations., Conclusions., I will define,  in conclusion,  the part I have personally, taken in the researches upon radio-active bodies., I have investigated the radio-activity of uranium compounds., I have examined other bodies for the existence of, radio-activity,  and found the property to be possessed by, thorium compounds. I have made clear the atomic, 94, character of the radio-activity of the compounds of uranium, and thorium., I have conducted a research upon radio-active substances, other than uranium and thorium. To this end I investigated, a large number of substances by an accurate electrometric, method,  and I discovered that certain minerals, possess activity which is not to be accounted for by their, content of uranium and thorium., From this I concluded that these minerals must contain, a radio-active body different from uranium and thorium, and more strongly radio-active than the latter metals., In conjunction with M. Curie,  and subsequently with, MM. Curie and Bémont,  I was able to extract from pitchblende, two strongly radio-active bodies—polonium and, radium., I have been continuously engaged upon the chemical examination, and preparation of these substances. I effected, the fractionations necessary to the concentration of radium, and I succeeded in isolating pure radium chloride. Concurrently, with this work,  I made several atomic weight, determinations with a very small quantity of material,  and, was finally able to determine the atomic weight of radium, with a very fair degree of accuracy. The work has proved, that radium is a new chemical element, . Thus the new, method of investigating new chemical elements,  established, by M. Curie and myself,  based upon radio-activity,  is fully, justified., I have investigated the law of absorption of polonium, rays,  and of the absorbable rays of radium,  and have demonstrated, that this law of absorption is peculiar and, different from the known laws of other radiations., I have investigated the variation of activity of radium, salts,  the effect of solution and of heating,  and the renewal, of activity with time,  after solution or after heating., In conjunction with M. Curie,  I have examined different, effects produced by the new radio-active substances (electric, photographic,  fluorescent,  luminous colourations,  &c.)., In conjunction with M. Curie,  I have established the fact, that radium gives rise to rays charged with negative electricity., Our researches upon the new radio-active bodies have, given rise to a scientific movement,  and have been the, starting-point of numerous researches in connection with, new radio-active substances,  and with the investigation of, the radiation of the known radio-active bodies., RADIUM, AND OTHER, RADIO-ACTIVE ELEMENTS., A Popular account of Radium and other Radio-active Elements treated experimentally., Including a number of Radium Photographs and other Illustrations., By LEONARD A.

interview,"Warsaw was then under Russian domination, and one of the worst aspects of this control was the oppression exerted on the school and the child. The private schools directed by Poles were closely watched by the police and overburdened with the necessity of teaching the Russian language even to children so young that they could scarcely speak their native Polish. Nevertheless, since the teachers were nearly all of Polish nationality, they endeavored in every possible way to mitigate the difficulties resulting from the national persecution. These schools, however, could not legally give diplomas, which were obtainable only in the schools of the government. These schools, entirely Russian, were directly opposed to the Polish national spirit. All instruction was given in Russian, by Russian professors, who, being hostile to the Polish nation, treated their pupils as enemies. Men of moral and intellectual distinction could scarcely agree to teach in schools where an alien attitude was forced upon them. So what the pupils were taught was of questionable value, and the moral atmosphere was altogether unbearable. Constantly held in suspicion and spied upon, the children knew that a single conversation in Polish, or an imprudent word, might seriously harm, not only themselves, but also their families. Amidst these hostilities, they lost all the joy of life, and precocious feelings of distrust and indignation weighed upon their childhood. On the other side, this abnormal situation resulted in exciting the patriotic feeling of Polish youths to the highest degree.(from Autobiographical Notes pp. 158-159.)"
interview,"I was only fifteen when I finished my high-school studies, always having held first rank in my class. The fatigue of growth and study compelled me to take almost a year’s rest in the country. I then returned to my father in Warsaw, hoping to teach in the free schools. But family circumstances obliged me to change my decision. My father, now aged and tired, needed rest; his fortune was very modest. So I resolved to accept a position as governess for several children. Thus, when scarcely seventeen, I left my father’s house to begin an independent life. That going away remains one of the most vivid memories of my youth. My heart was heavy as I climbed into the railway car. It was to carry me for several hours, away from those I loved. And after the railway journey I must drive for five hours longer. What experience was awaiting me? So I questioned as I sat close to the car window looking out across the wide plains.(from Autobiographical Notes p. 163.)"
interview,"I continued my efforts to educate myself. This was no easy task under the Russian government of Warsaw; yet I found more opportunities than in the country. To my great joy, I was able, for the first time in my life, to find access to a laboratory: a small municipal physical laboratory directed by one of my cousins. I found little time to work there, except in the evenings and on Sundays, and was generally left to myself. I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success, at others I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience. But on the whole, though I was taught that the way of progress is neither swift nor easy, this first trial confirmed in me the taste for experimental research in the fields of physics and chemistry. Other means of instruction came to me through my being one of an enthusiastic group of young men and women of Warsaw, who united in a common desire to study, and whose activities were at the same time social and patriotic. It was one of those groups of Polish youths who believed that the hope of their country lay in a great effort to develop the intellectual and moral strength of the nation, and that such an effort would lead to a better national situation. The nearest purpose was to work at one’s own instruction and to provide means of instruction for workmen and peasants. In accordance with this program we agreed among ourselves to give evening courses, each one teaching what he knew best. There is no need to say that this was a secret organization, which made everything extremely difficult. There were in our group very devoted young people who, as I still believe today, could do truly useful work. I have a bright remembrance of the sympathetic intellectual and social companionship which I enjoyed at that time. Truly the means of action were poor and the results obtained could not be considerable; yet I still believe that the ideas which inspired us then are the only way to real social progress. You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 167-168.)"
interview,"It would be impossible to tell of all the good these years brought to me. Undistracted by any outside occupation, I was entirely absorbed in the joy of learning and understanding. Yet, all the while, my living conditions were far from easy, my own funds being small and my family not having the means to aid me as they would have liked to do. However, my situation was not exceptional; it was the familiar experience of many of the Polish students whom I knew. The room I lived in was in a garret, very cold in winter, for it was insufficiently heated by a small stove which often lacked coal. During a particularly rigorous winter, it was not unusual for the water to freeze in the basin in the night; to be able to sleep I was obliged to pile all my clothes on the bedcovers. In the same room I prepared my meals with the aid of an alcohol lamp and a few kitchen utensils. These meals were often reduced to bread with a cup of chocolate, eggs or fruit. I had no help in housekeeping and I myself carried the little coal I used up the six flights. This life, painful from certain points of view, had, for all that, a real charm for me. It gave me a very precious sense of liberty and independence. Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the feeling of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid, did not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome, my usual state of mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction. All my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the beginning, were difficult. In fact, I was insufficiently prepared to follow the physical science course at the Sorbonne, for, despite all my efforts, I had not succeeded in acquiring in Poland a preparation as complete as that of the French students following the same course. So I was obliged to supply this deficiency, especially in mathematics. I divided my time between courses, experimental work, and study in the library. In the evening I worked in my room, sometimes very late into the night. All that I saw and learned that was new delighted me. It was like a new world opened to me, the world of science, which I was at last permitted to know in all liberty.(from Autobiographical Notes pp. 170-171.)I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894.... A Polish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre Curie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and his wife. As I entered the room, Pierre Curie was standing in the recess of a French window opening on a balcony. He seemed to me very young, though he was at that time thirty-five years old. I was struck by the open expression of his face and by the slight suggestion of detachment in his whole attitude. His speech, rather slow and deliberate, his simplicity, and his smile, at once grave and youthful, inspired confidence. We began a conversation which soon became friendly. It first concerned certain scientific matters about which I was very glad to be able to ask his opinion. Then we discussed certain social and humanitarian subjects which interested us both. There was, between his conceptions and mine, despite the difference between our native countries, a surprising kinship, no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral atmosphere in which we were both raised by our families. We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked if he might call upon me.... Pierre Curie came to see me, and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and he asked me to share that life. It was not, however, easy for me to make such a decision, for it meant separation from my country and my family, and the renouncement of certain social projects that were dear to me. Having grown up in an atmosphere of patriotism kept alive by the oppression of Poland, I wished, like many other young people of my country, to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national spirit.... During the year 1894 Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was.... It is appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the possibility of our marriage: “We have promised each other (is it not true?) to have, the one for the other, at least a great affection. Provided that you do not change your mind! For there are no promises which hold; these are things that do not admit of compulsion. “It would, nevertheless, be a beautiful thing in which I hardly dare believe, to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your dream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science. Of all these dreams, I believe the last, alone, is legitimate. I mean to say by this that we are powerless to change the social order. Even if this were not true we should not know what to do.... From the point of view of science, on the contrary, we can pretend to accomplish something. The territory here is more solid and obvious, and however small it is, it is truly in our possession.” One can understand, from this letter, that for Pierre Curie there was only one way of looking at the future. He had dedicated his life to his dream of science: he felt the need of a companion who could live his dream with him (from Pierre Curie pp. 72-77.)"
interview,"It became a serious problem how to take care of our little Irène and of our home without giving up my scientific work. Such a renunciation would have been very painful to me, and my husband would not even think of it; he used to say that he had got a wife made expressly for him to share all his preoccupations. Neither of us would contemplate abandoning what was so precious to both. Of course we had to have a servant, but I personally saw to all the details of the child’s care. While I was in the laboratory, she was in the care of her grandfather, who loved her tenderly and whose own life was made brighter by her. So the close union of our family enabled me to meet my obligations. Things were particularly difficult only in case of more exceptional events, such as a child’s illness, when sleepless nights interrupted the normal course of life. It can be easily understood that there was no place in our life for worldly relations. We saw but a few friends, scientific workers, like ourselves, with whom we talked in our home or in our garden, while I did some sewing for my little girl. We also maintained affectionate relations with my husband’s brother and his family. But I was separated from all my relatives, as my sister had left Paris with her husband to live in Poland. It was under this mode of quiet living, organized according to our desires, that we achieved the great work of our lives, work begun about the end of 1897 and lasting for many years. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 179-180.)"
interview,"My experiments proved that the radiation of uranium compounds can be measured with precision under determined conditions, and that this radiation is an atomic property of the element of uranium. Its intensity is proportional to the quantity of uranium contained in the compound, and depends neither on conditions of chemical combination, nor on external circumstances, such as light or temperature. I undertook next to discover if there were other elements possessing the same property, and with this aim I examined all the elements then known, either in their pure state or in compounds. I found that among these bodies, thorium compounds are the only ones which emit rays similar to those of uranium. The radiation of thorium has an intensity of the same order as that of uranium, and is, as in the case of uranium, an atomic property of the element.... During the course of my research, I had had occasion to examine not only simple compounds, salts and oxides, but also a great number of minerals. Certain ones proved radioactive; these were those containing uranium and thorium; but their radioactivity seemed abnormal, for it was much greater than the amount I had found in uranium and thorium had led me to expect. This abnormality greatly surprised us. When I had assured myself that it was not due to an error in the experiment, it became necessary to find an explanation. I then made the hypothesis that the ores uranium and thorium contain in small quantity a substance much more strongly radioactive than either uranium or thorium. This substance could not be one of the known elements, because these had already been examined; it must, therefore, be a new chemical element. I had a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible. And Pierre Curie, keenly interested in the question, abandoned his work on crystals (provisionally, he thought) to join me in the search for this unknown substance. We chose, for our work, the ore pitchblende, a uranium ore, which in its pure state is about four times more active than oxide of uranium. Since the composition of this ore was known through very careful chemical analysis, we could expect to find, at a maximum, 1 per cent of new substance. The result of our experiment proved that there were in reality new radioactive elements in pitchblende, but that their proportion did not reach even a millionth per cent!(from Pierre Curie pp. 96-98.)"
interview,"The School of Physics could give us no suitable premises, but for lack of anything better, the Director permitted us to use an abandoned shed which had been in service as a dissecting room of the School of Medicine. Its glass roof did not afford complete shelter against rain; the heat was suffocating in summer, and the bitter cold of winter was only a little lessened by the iron stove, except in its immediate vicinity. There was no question of obtaining the needed proper apparatus in common use by chemists. We simply had some old pine-wood tables with furnaces and gas burners. We had to use the adjoining yard for those of our chemical operations that involved producing irritating gases; even then the gas often filled our shed. With this equipment we entered on our exhausting work. Yet it was in this miserable old shed that we passed the best and happiest years of our life, devoting our entire days to our work. Often I had to prepare our lunch in the shed, so as not to interrupt some particularly important operation. Sometimes I had to spend a whole day mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the day’s end. Other days, on the contrary, the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional crystallization, in the effort to concentrate the radium. I was then annoyed by the floating dust of iron and coal from which I could not protect my precious products. But I shall never be able to express the joy of the untroubled quietness of this atmosphere of research and the excitement of actual progress with the confident hope of still better results. The feeling of discouragement that sometimes came after some unsuccessful toil did not last long and gave way to renewed activity. We had happy moments devoted to a quiet discussion of our work, walking around our shed. One of our joys was to go into our workroom at night; we then perceived on all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes of the bottles or capsules containing our products. It was really a lovely sight and one always new to us. The glowing tubes looked like faint, fairy lights. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 186-187.)"
interview,"The first experiments on the biological properties of radium were successfully made in France with samples from our laboratory, while my husband was living. The results were, at once, encouraging, so that the new branch of medical science, called radiumtherapy (in France, Curietherapy), developed rapidly, first in France and later in other countries. To supply the radium wanted for this purpose, a radium-producing industry was established. The first plant was created in France and worked very successfully, but afterwards manufactures were founded in other countries, the most important of which are now in America, where great quantities of radium ore, named “carnotite,” are available. The radiumtherapy and the radium production developed conjointly, and the results were more and more important for the treatment of several diseases, and particularly of cancer. As a consequence of this, several institutes have been founded, in the large cities, for the application of the new therapy. Some of these institutes own several grams of radium, the commercial price of the gram being now about $70,000, the cost of production depending on the very small proportion of radium in the ore. It may be easily understood how deeply I appreciated the privilege of realizing that our discovery had become a benefit to mankind, not only through its great scientific importance, but also by its power of efficient action against human suffering and terrible disease. This was indeed a splendid reward for our years of hard toil. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 199-200.)"
interview,"In 1903 I finished my doctor's thesis and obtained the degree. At the end of the same year the Nobel prize was awarded jointly to Becquerel, my husband and me for the discovery of radioactivity and new radioactive elements. This event greatly increased the publicity of our work. For some time there was no more peace. Visitors and demands for lectures and articles interrupted every day....The fatigue resulting from the effort exceeding our forces, imposed by the unsatisfactory conditions of our labor, was augmented by the invasion of publicity. The overturn of our voluntary isolation was a cause of real suffering for us and had all the effect of disaster. It was serious trouble brought into the organization of our life, and I have already explained how indispensable was our freedom from external distraction, in order to maintain our family life and our scientific activity. Of course, people who contribute to that kind of trouble generally mean it kindly. It is only that they do not realize the conditions of the problem.(from Autobiographical Notes pp. 190-191.)"
interview,"In 1906 just as we were definitely giving up the old shed laboratory where we had been so happy, there came the dreadful catastrophe which took my husband away from me and left me alone to bring up our children and, at the same time, to continue our work of research. It is impossible for me to express the profoundness and importance of the crisis brought into my life by the loss of the one who had been my closest companion and best friend. Crushed by the blow, I did not feel able to face the future. I could not forget, however, what my husband used sometimes to say, that, even deprived of him, I ought to continue my work. The death of my husband, coming immediately after the general knowledge of the discoveries with which his name is associated, was felt by the public, and especially by the scientific circles, to be a national misfortune. It was largely under the influence of this emotion that the Faculty of Sciences of Paris decided to offer me the chair, as professor, which my husband had occupied only one year and a half in the Sorbonne. It was an exceptional decision, as up to then no woman had held such a position.... The honor that now came to me was deeply painful under the cruel circumstances of its coming. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 191-192.)"
interview,"We put you into the coffin Saturday morning, and I held your head up for this move. We kissed your cold face for the last time. Then a few periwinkles from the garden on the coffin and the little picture of me that you called “the good little student” and that you loved. It is the picture that must go with you into the grave, the picture of her who had the happiness of pleasing you enough so that you did not hesitate to offer to share your life with her, even when you had seen her only a few times. You often told me that this was the only occasion in your life when you acted without hesitation, with the absolute conviction that you were doing well. My Pierre, I think you were not wrong. We were made to live together, and our union had to be. Your coffin was closed and I could see you no more. I didn’t allow them to cover it with the horrible black cloth. I covered it with flowers and I sat beside it.... They filled the grave and put sheaves of flowers on it. Everything is over, Pierre is sleeping his last sleep beneath the earth; it is the end of everything, everything, everything. I am working in the laboratory all day long, it is all I can do; I am better off there than anywhere else. I conceive of nothing any more that could give me personal joy, except perhaps scientific work–and even there, no, because if I succeeded with it, I would not endure you not to know it. (from Madame Curie p. 249.)"
interview,"The dominant duty imposed on everyone at that time was to help the country in whatever way possible during the extreme crisis that it faced. No general instructions to this were given to the members of the University. It was left to each to take his own initiative and means of action.... During the rapid succession of events in August 1914, it was clearly proved that the preparation for defense was insufficient. Public feeling was especially aroused by the realization of the grave failings which appeared in the organization of the Health Service. My own attention was particularly drawn to this situation, and I soon found a field of activity which, once entered upon, absorbed the greatest part of my time and efforts until the end of the war, and even for some time thereafter.... It is well known that the X-rays offer surgeons and doctors extremely useful means for the examination of the sick and wounded.... However, at the beginning of the war, the Military Board of Health had no organization of radiology, while the civil organization was also but little developed. Radiologic installations existed in only a small number of important hospitals, and there were only a few specialists in the large cities. The numerous new hospitals that were established all over France in the first months of the war had, as a rule, no installation for the use of X-rays. To meet this need I first gathered together all the apparatus I could find in the laboratories and stores. With this equipment I established in August and September, 1914, several stations of radiology, the operation of which was assured by volunteer helpers to whom I gave instruction. These stations rendered great service during the battle of the Marne. But as they could not satisfy the needs of all the hospitals of the Paris region, I fitted up, with the help of the Red Cross, a radiologic car. It was simply a touring motor-car, arranged for the transport of a complete radiologic apparatus, together with a dynamo that was worked by the engine of the car, and furnished the electric current necessary for the production of the rays. This car could come at the call of any of the hospitals, large or small, in the surroundings of Paris. Cases of urgent need were frequent, for these hospitals had to take care of the wounded who could not be transported to more distant places. (from Autobiographical Notes pp. 208-211.)"
interview,"The story of radiology in war offers a striking example of the unsuspected amplitude that the application of purely scientific discoveries can take under certain conditions. X rays had had only a limited usefulness up to the time of the war. The great catastrophe which was let loose upon humanity, accumulating its victims in terrifying numbers, brought up by reaction the ardent desire to save everything that could be saved and to exploit every means of sparing and protecting human life. At once there appeared an effort to make the X ray yield its maximum of service. What had seemed difficult became easy and received an immediate solution. The material and the personnel were multiplied as if by enchantment. All those who did not understand gave in or accepted; those who did not know learned; those who had been indifferent became devoted. Thus the scientific discovery achieved the conquest of its natural field of action. A similar evolution took place in radiumtherapy, or the medical application of radiations emitted by the radio elements. What are we to conclude from this unhoped-for development shared between the new radiations revealed to us by science at the end of the nineteenth century? It seems that they must make our confidence in disinterested research more alive and increase our reverence and admiration for it. (from Madame Curie p. 306.)"
interview,"As you have seen, fortune favors us at this moment; but these favors of fortune do not come without many worries. We have never been less tranquil than at this moment. There are days when we scarcely have time to breathe. And to think that we dreamed of living in the wild, quite removed from human beings! (Letters from Pierre Curie to his friend E. Gouy, 20 March 1902)"
interview,"I have wanted to write to you for a long time; excuse me if I have not done so. The cause is the stupid life which I lead at present. You have seen this sudden infatuation for radium, which has resulted for us in all the advantages of a moment of popularity. We have been pursued by journalists and photographers from all countries of the world; they have gone even so far as to report the conversation between my daughter and her nurse, and to describe the black- and-white cat that lives with us.... Further, we have had a great many appeals for money.... Finally, the collectors of autographs, snobs, society people, and even at times, scientists, have come to see us—in our magnificent and tranquil quarters in the laboratory—and every evening there has been a voluminous correspondence to send off. With such a state of things I feel myself invaded by a kind of stupor. And yet all this turmoil will not perhaps have been in vain, if it results in my getting a chair and a laboratory.

interview,"We have regretted so much being deprived of your visit this year, but hope to see you in October. If we do not make an effort from time to time, we end by losing touch with our best and most congenial friends, and in keeping company with others for the simple reason that it is easy to meet them. We continue to lead the same life of people who are extremely occupied, without being able to accomplish anything interesting. It is now more than a year since I have been able to engage in any research, and I have no moment to myself. Clearly I have not yet discovered a means to defend ourselves against this frittering away of our time which is nevertheless extremely necessary. Intellectually, it is a question of life or death. (25 July 1905)"
interview,"I am neither very well, nor very ill; but I am easily fatigued, and I have left but very little capacity for work. My wife, on the contrary, leads a very active life, between her children, the School at Sèvres, and the laboratory. She does not lose a minute, and occupies herself more regularly than I can with the direction of the laboratory in which she passes the greater part of the day. (7 November 1905)"
interview,"Paris, Monday, 31 August 1914 (At this time the German Army was threatening Paris). Dear Irène, I’ve just received your sweet letter of Saturday and I wanted so much to hug you that I almost cried. This morning I was able to make my way to the train station where Fernand and Margaret were to leave—and I didn’t manage to see them. I wonder if they’ve left. Things are not going very well, and we all have a heavy heart and disturbed spirit. We need great courage and I hope we will not lack it. We must keep the firm hope that after these bad days, good times will return. It’s in that hope that I lock you in my heart, my beloved daughters. Mé [Mom] (from Correspondance pp. 129, 158.)"
interview,"Poperinghe, 24 January 1915 (Near Dunkirk). Dear Irène, After various wanderings, we’ve arrived here, but we can’t make an attempt at working until we’ve made some modifications at the hospital. They want to build a shelter for the car and a partition to create the radiology room in a big ward. That all holds up the work, but it’s difficult to do otherwise. In Dunkirk, German planes dropped some bombs that killed a few people, but the populace is scarcely frightened. At Poperinghe too these accidents happen, but less often. We hear the guns grumbling almost constantly. It’s not raining, a bit of frost. We were welcomed at the hospital with extreme cordiality, I have a nice room and they give me a fire in a stove at the side. I’m better off than at Furnes, I’ll eat at the hospital. With a hug, Mé (from Correspondance pp. 129, 158.)"
interview,"Prague, Sunday, 14 June 1925. Dear Irène, I got your letter of June 5 which arrived in Warsaw the 12th. I find that [delay] excessive... I arrived in Prague this morning and will leave tomorrow evening for Jachymow. I’m bewildered by the life I’m leading and incapable of telling you anything intelligent. I ask myself, what fundamental vice is there in the organization of humanity that makes this sort of agitation, to a certain degree, necessary? Mrs. Meloney [the American journalist who encouraged Marie to expose herself to the press] would call it, “Dignifying science.” And what’s undeniable is the sincerity of everyone who does these things and their conviction that they are necessary. Here I’m in a magnificent apartment, bedroom, sitting-room and bathroom, overlooking the river bordered by hills, and full of flowers they gave me at the train station—mostly roses since it’s their season. Unfortunately it’s gray, and I’m afraid it will rain.... With hugs, Mé (from Correspondance p. 255.)"
interview,"Constantly held in suspicion and spied upon, the children knew that a single conversation in Polish, or an imprudent word, might seriously harm, not only themselves, but also their families.(Marie Curie)I easily learned mathematics and physics, as far as these sciences were taken in consideration in the school. I found in this ready help from my father, who loved science....Unhappily, he had no laboratory and could not perform experiments. (Marie Curie)"

But the Polish-born scientist,  almost pathologically shy and accustomed to spending most of her time in her Paris laboratory,  was stunned by the fanfare that greeted her., She attended a luncheon on her first day at the house of Mrs. Andrew Carnegie before receptions at the Waldorf Astoria and Carnegie Hall. She would later appear at the American Museum of Natural History,  where an exhibit commemorated her discovery of radium. The American Chemical Society,  the New York Mineralogical Club,  cancer research facilities and the Bureau of Mines held events in her honor. Later that week,  2, 000 Smith College students sang Curie’s praises in a choral concert before bestowing her with an honorary degree. Dozens more colleges and universities,  including Yale,  Wellesley and the University of Chicago,  conferred honors on her., The marquee event of her six-week U.S. tour was held in the East Room of the White House. President Warren Harding spoke at length,  praising her “great attainments in the realms of science and intellect” and saying she represented the best in womanhood. “We lay at your feet the testimony of that love which all the generations of men have been wont to bestow upon the noble woman,  the unselfish wife,  the devoted mother.”, It was a rather odd thing to say to the most decorated scientist of that era,  but then again Marie Curie was never easy to understand or categorize. That was because she was a pioneer,  an outlier,  unique for the newness and immensity of her achievements. But it was also because of her sex. Curie worked during a great age of innovation,  but proper women of her time were thought to be too sentimental to perform objective science. She would forever be considered a bit strange,  not just a great scientist but a great, woman, scientist. You would not expect the president of the United States to praise one of Curie’s male contemporaries by calling attention to his manhood and his devotion as a father. Professional science until fairly recently was a man’s world,  and in Curie’s time it was rare for a woman even to participate in academic physics,  never mind triumph over it., This year marks the 100th anniversary of her second Nobel Prize,  the first time anyone had achieved such a feat. In her honor,  the United Nations named 2011 the International Year of Chemistry. Curie has always been a fascinating character,  the subject of books and plays and movies,  and this anniversary has prompted several new works about her. October is Nobel Prize season,  so it’s a good time to examine the story of her story—how she lived,  but also how she has been mythologized and misunderstood., Curie was born Manya Sklodowska in November 1867 in Warsaw,  Poland,  and raised there during a Russian occupation. Her mother died of tuberculosis when Marie was 10 years old. A prodigy in both literature and math,  as a teenager Marie attended a secret school called the “Floating University”—its locale changed regularly to avoid detection by the Russians—which taught physics and natural history as well as the forbidden subjects of Polish history and culture. Her father,  a science teacher,  encouraged his daughter’s curiosity but could not afford to send her to college. Marie worked as a governess until,  at 24,  she had saved enough money and purchased a train ticket to Paris,  where she gravitated to the Latin Quarter and enrolled at the Sorbonne., She immersed herself in French and math and made ends meet cleaning glassware in university labs. She rationed her intake of food until,  on more than one occasion,  she collapsed of weakness. Science thrilled her,  and she earned a degree in physics in 1893 and another in mathematics the following year., In 1894,  she met Pierre Curie,  a 35-year-old physicist at a French technical college who had been studying crystals and magnetism. More than a decade before,  he and his brother Jacques had discovered piezoelectricity,  the electric charge produced in solid materials under pressure. Pierre was taken by Marie’s uncommon intellect and drive,  and he proposed to her. “It would...be a beautiful thing, ” he wrote,  “to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your dream for your country; our dream for humanity; our dream for science.”, They were married in 1895 in a civil service attended by family and a few friends. For the occasion,  Marie donned a blue cotton dress,  one practical enough to wear in the laboratory after the ceremony. From then on,  she and Pierre followed what they called an “anti-natural” path that included a “renunciation of the pleasures of life.” They lived plainly in their apartment on the rue de la Glacière within walking distance of their experiments. Pierre earned a modest 6, 000 francs per year,  about $30, 000 today,  while Marie worked gratis in his laboratory and prepared for an exam that would certify her to teach girls., The Curies’ first daughter,  Irène,  was born in 1897. A difficult pregnancy had forced Marie to spend less time in the lab just as she was gathering data for a doctoral thesis. When her mother-in-law died weeks after Irène’s birth,  her father-in-law,  Eugene,  a retired physician,  stepped in,  becoming the hands-on parent that others expected Marie to be., By the time her second daughter,  Eve,  was born in 1904,  Marie had grown accustomed to the disdain of colleagues who thought she spent too much time in the lab and not enough in the nursery. Georges Sagnac,  a friend and collaborator,  eventually confronted her. “Don’t you love Irène?” he asked. “It seems to me that I wouldn’t prefer the idea of reading a paper by [Ernest] Rutherford,  to getting what my body needs and looking after such an agreeable little girl.”, But read scientific publications she did. In labs across Europe,  scientists were studying new and surprising phenomena. In 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen had discovered X-rays,  and the mathematician Henri Poincaré sought to understand the luminescent rays that could pass through a hand and impress a ghostly image on photographic paper. Henri Becquerel was noting the emission of a different kind of mysterious rays,  those from uranium salts. J. J. Thomson discovered negatively charged particles,  which we now know as electrons (and which we now know are the source of X-rays)., Curie built on Becquerel’s observations of the element uranium. At first,  she and other scientists were baffled about the source of the high-energy emissions. “The uranium shows no appreciable change of state,  no visible chemical transformation,  it remains,  in appearance at least,  the same as ever,  the source of the energy it discharges remains undetectable, ” she wrote in 1900. She wondered whether the emitted rays were violating a basic law of thermodynamics: the conservation of energy., Finally,  she posited a daring hypothesis: The rays emitted might be a basic property of uranium atoms,  which we now know to be subatomic particles released as the atoms decay. Her theory had radical implications. Trish Baisden,  a senior chemist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,  describes it as a shocking proposal: “It was truly amazing and a bold statement at the time because the atom was thought to be the most elementary particle,  one that could not be divided. It further meant that atoms are not necessarily stable.” Curie’s hypothesis would revise the scientific understanding of matter at its most elemental level., Curie set out to measure the intensity of uranium’s rays by adapting the electrometer Pierre had invented with his brother. The device allowed her to measure extremely low electrical currents in air near mineral samples that contained uranium. She soon repeated the experiment with thorium,  which behaved in similar ways., But she was puzzled by data that showed that the intensity of the radiation emitted by uranium and thorium was greater than expected based on the amounts of the elements she knew to be in her samples. “There must be,  I thought,  some unknown substance,  very active,  in these minerals, ” she concluded. “My husband agreed with me and I urged that we search at once for this hypothetical substance,  thinking that,  with joined efforts,  a result would be quickly obtained.”, In 1898 she indeed identified one of the substances and named it polonium,  after her homeland. Five months later,  she identified a second element,  which the world came to know as radium. Curie described the elements she studied as “radio-active.”, Pierre put his crystals aside to help his wife isolate these radioactive elements and study their properties. Marie extracted pure radium salts from pitchblende,  a highly radioactive ore obtained from mines in Bohemia. The extraction required tons of the substance,  which she dissolved in cauldrons of acid before obtaining barium sulphate and other alkalines,  which she then purified and converted into chlorides. The separation of radium from the alkalines required thousands of tedious crystallizations. But as she wrote to her brother in 1894,  “one never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.” After four years,  Curie had accumulated barely enough pure radium to fill a thimble., Working in a dilapidated shed with broken windows and poor ventilation,  she nonetheless was able to make sensitive measurements. It is remarkable,  says Baisden,  that Curie calculated the atomic weight of radium so accurately given such deplorable conditions. “Large swings in temperature and humidity undoubtedly affected the electrometer...but Marie’s patience and tenacity prevailed.”, Both Curies were plagued by ailments—burns and fatigue—that,  in retrospect,  were clearly caused by repeated exposures to high doses of radiation. Both,  too,  were resistant to the suggestion that their research materials caused their ailments., In 1903,  Curie became the first woman in France to earn a PhD in physics. Professors who reviewed her doctoral thesis,  which was about radiation,  declared that it was the greatest single contribution to science ever written., Rumors of a Nobel Prize began to circulate,  but some members of the French Academy of Sciences attributed the brilliance of the work not to Marie,  but to her co-workers. These skeptics began to lobby quietly for the prize to be split between Becquerel and Pierre. But Pierre insisted to influential people on the Nobel committee that Marie had originated their research,  conceived experiments and generated theories about the nature of radioactivity., Both Curies shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel in 1903. It was the first Nobel to be awarded to a woman., At the awards ceremony,  the president of the Swedish Academy,  which administered the prize,  quoted the Bible in his remarks about the Curies’ research: “It is not good that man should be alone,  I will make a helpmeet for him.”, Whether Marie Curie took the remark as an insult is not known—it surely rankles today—but it must be among the most grudging comments ever said to a laureate. Moreover,  the notion that Marie was a mere helpmeet to Pierre—one of the more persistent myths about her—was an opinion widely held,  judging from published and unpublished comments by other scientists and observers., “Errors are notoriously hard to kill, ” observed her friend,  the British physicist Hertha Ayrton,  “but an error that ascribes to a man what was actually the work of a woman has more lives than a cat.”, At the Sorbonne,  it was Pierre who got the plum job,  a full professorship. Marie was not promoted. Pierre hired more assistants and made Marie the official head of the laboratory,  freeing her to conduct experiments and for the first time,  be paid for it., The most successful collaboration between a husband and wife in the history of science ended suddenly on April 19,  1906,  when Pierre,  apparently lost in thought,  walked into traffic on the rue Dauphine and was killed instantly by an onrushing carriage., Instead of accepting a widow’s pension,  Marie took over Pierre’s position at the Sorbonne,  becoming the first woman to teach there. Hundreds of people—students,  artists,  photographers,  celebrities—lined up outside the university on November 5,  1906,  hoping to attend her first lecture. She gave no outward sign of mourning. She began by summarizing the recent breakthroughs in physics research. “When one considers the progress of physics in the last decade, ” she said,  “one is surprised by the changes it has produced in our ideas about electricity and about matter.”, She wrote a diary during this time,  addressed to her late husband,  about continuing their research. “I am working in the laboratory all day long,  it is all I can do: I am better off there than anywhere else, ” she wrote. In 1910,  she published a 971-page treatise on radioactivity. Some men in the scientific establishment still didn’t consider her an equal,  however; she applied for membership in the French Academy of Sciences in 1910,  and although Pierre had been a member,  she was denied by two votes. One Academy member,  the physicist Emile Amagat,  claimed that “women cannot be part of the Institute of France.”, In 1911,  rumors spread that Curie was having an affair with the prominent physicist Paul Langevin,  a man five years her junior who had been Pierre’s student and had worked closely with Albert Einstein. Langevin’s estranged wife discovered apparent love letters from Curie to her husband and gave them to a tabloid newspaper. It and other publications ran stories with headlines such as “A Romance in a Laboratory.” Although a widower under similar circumstances would likely not have suffered any consequences,  Curie found her reputation tarnished. Neither Curie nor Langevin discussed their relationship with outsiders. “I believe there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life, ” she wrote to a critic., The front-page coverage of the scandal threatened to overshadow another news story later that year: her second Nobel Prize., This one,  in chemistry,  was for the discovery of polonium and radium. In her acceptance speech in Stockholm,  she paid tribute to her husband but also made clear that her work was independent from his,  spelling out their separate contributions and describing the discoveries she had made after his death., At the end of 1911,  Curie became very ill. She had an operation to remove lesions from her uterus and kidney,  followed by a long recovery. In 1913,  she began to travel again and return to science. In March of that year,  Einstein paid her an extended visit,  and later she opened and headed a new research facility in Warsaw. As she was setting up a second institute,  in Paris,  World War I broke out. She outfitted 18 portable X-ray stations that could treat wounded soldiers on the front lines. She sometimes operated and repaired the machines herself,  and established 200 more permanent X-ray posts during the war., Eve became a journalist and wrote the definitive biography, Madame Curie,  published in 1937. Irène studied at her mother’s institute in Paris and married her mother’s assistant,  the charismatic physicist Frédéric Joliot,  with whom she bore two children. Irène maintained a strong presence in the lab,  and in 1935,  Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie were awarded a Nobel Prize for synthesizing new radioactive elements. It was another record: the first time both a parent and child had separately won the Nobel Prize., After Marie Curie’s second Nobel Prize and her subsequent research,  she was rarely dismissed as a helpmeet. And once the tabloids moved on from the Langevin scandal,  her image as a homewrecker faded. But there were deliberate efforts to shape her story. A case in point was Curie’s first trip to America,  in 1921., The tour was largely the work of a New York City journalist named Missy Meloney,  who had interviewed Curie in 1920 in Paris for the women’s magazine the, Delineator,  which Meloney edited. Meloney learned that the Curies had never patented the process for purifying radium. As a result,  other scientists and U.S. chemical companies were processing radium,  then selling it for cancer treatments and military research for $100, 000 per gram. Curie was now unable to afford the element she had discovered. Sensing a human-interest story,  Meloney created the Marie Curie Radium Fund to raise money to purchase radium for Curie’s continuing research., American women would be inspired to give to Curie,  Meloney figured,  only if her image as a scientist—which stereotypically suggested someone dispassionate,  even severe—could be softened. So Meloney’s articles presented Curie as a benevolent healer,  intent on using radium to treat cancer. Meloney also persuaded editor friends at other newspapers and magazines to emphasize the same image. Curie understood that radium might be useful in the clinic,  but she had no direct role in using it for medical treatments. Nevertheless,  Curie’s motivation for discovering radium,  according to a headline in the, Delineator,  was “That Millions Shall Not Die.” Writers described her as the “Jeanne D’Arc of the laboratory, ” with a face of “suffering and patience.”, Curie disapproved of the publicity campaign. In lectures,  she reminded her audience that her discovery of radium was the work “of pure science...done for itself” rather than with “direct usefulness” in mind., And yet Meloney’s efforts succeeded: She raised more than $100, 000 on Curie’s behalf within months,  enough to buy a gram of radium for the Curie Institute in Paris. Meloney invited Curie to the United States., Curie,  who disliked travel and attention,  agreed to come to thank Meloney and those who had contributed to the cause. But,  she wrote Meloney,  “you know how careful I am to avoid all publicity referring to my name. And how I should be very grateful to arrange for my voyage with the minimum of publicity.”, Curie sailed with Irène,  23,  and Eve,  16,  and within hours of disembarking in New York embarked on a whirlwind tour that took her as far west as the Grand Canyon. As it wore on,  Curie became exhausted and asked to cancel events,  or at least not have to speak at them. She appeared aloof and sometimes refused to shake hands with admirers. She did not appear to be the kindly maternal figure that Meloney had made her out to be. Clearly,  Curie’s strength and patience were wearing thin., She carried the gram of radium home to Paris in a vial handed to her by President Harding at the White House. She worked in her laboratory until her death., When Curie died,  at age 66 in 1934,  journalists echoed the image popularized by Meloney. The, New York Times, called her a “martyr to science” who “contributed more to the general welfare of mankind” as a “modest,  self-effacing woman.” The physicist Robert Millikan,  president of the California Institute of Technology,  issued a public statement: “In spite of her continuous absorption in her scientific work,  she has devoted much time to the cause of peace....She embodied in her person all the simpler,  homelier and yet most perfect virtues of womanhood.”, In the years after her death,  scientists,  historians,  artists and others have grappled with her story,  often highlighting qualities or imputing traits to her that reflected contemporary social values more than biographical truths. Curie’s portrayal in books and movies tended to emphasize her roles as wife,  mother and humanitarian at the expense of her importance as a brilliant physicist. Most memorably,  MGM’s, Madame Curie, (1943) featured Greer Garson as a devoted wife rather than a sometimes prickly,  independent scientist., With the women’s movement of the 1960s and ’70s,  Curie’s reputation as a remarkable scientist came to the fore. The physicist Rosalyn Yalow,  in an essay she wrote at the time of winning her own Nobel Prize in 1977 for research involving radioactive compounds,  said that Curie was her inspiration. Biographers attempted to depict the brilliance and complexity of this outsize character. A new play, Radiance,  written by the actor and director Alan Alda,  focuses on her relationships with Pierre and Langevin as well as her science. A new graphic novel, Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallou, t by Lauren Redniss,  examines Curie’s life in the context of radioactivity’s impact on history. It has a glow-in-the-dark cover., It’s taken a century,  but we can finally appreciate her as a multifaceted woman of uncommon intensity,  intelligence and will—a woman of courage,  conviction and yes,  contradictions. After a century we see her not as a caricature,  but as one of the 20th century’s most important scientists,  who was,  at the same time,  unmistakably,  reassuringly human., Julie Des Jardins,  of Baruch College,  wrote, The Madame Curie Complex: The Hidden History of Women in Science, ., /, The Nobel Prize citation awarded to Marie Curie., NobelPrize.org, /, Curie,  in Paris in 1925,  was awarded a then-unprecedented second Nobel Prize 100 years ago this month., AFP / Getty Images, /, Curie,  center,  with President and Mrs. Harding at the White House in 1921,  barely recognized the portrayal of herself in the American press., Snark / Art Resource,  NY, /, Marie and Pierre Curie,  in their laboratory,  followed what they called an ""anti-natural"" path,  renouncing pleasure for science., Scala / White Images / Art Resource,  NY, /, After Pierre's death,  Curie raised their daughters,  Eve and Irène., The Granger Collection,  New York / The Granger Collection, /, Curie also took over Pierre's position at the Sorbonne,  becoming the first woman to teach there.

Mental Toughness embraces what is commonly known as Resilience and adds the Optimism components of Challenge and Confidence to create a more complete model., Born Maria Sklodowska,  more than 150 years ago,  on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw,  Poland,  Marie Curie achieved iconic status as a remarkable scientist who developed what we now understand as “radioactivity”. She became the first person to achieve a Nobel Prize in two different disciplines for work that has transformed everyone’s lives forevermore. From very humble origins with little financial support and resources,  Marie,  and her husband Pierre,  isolated and identified Polonium and Radium when most of the scientific community didn’t believe in their existence., Her deep sense of purpose and value that drove her work ethic was working for the common good. For instance,  Marie developed the first ambulances with x-ray capability in WW1., Whilst today Marie Curie is celebrated as one of the world’s highest achievers in Science,  it is even more significant in light of the systemic norms of the day where not only were women not expected to work as scientists and raise a family,  but would commonly be held back from doing so., When invited to speak on their work at the Royal Institution in London,  only Pierre was allowed to speak. When the Nobel Prize committee awarded the first Nobel Prize in 1903,  they initially awarded it only to her husband. The Committee eventually relented and Marie became the first woman to receive a Nobel prize. Quite rightly Marie Curie was role-modelling what would become feminist ideals and she was changing the world through her beliefs and actions., When we look at the Control elements of Mental Toughness,  Marie demonstrated the sense of “can do” belief in self and her ideas despite widespread opposition in the scientific community. Renowned for her Emotional Control,  Einstein remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame., Curie herself said, “Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance.”, When we consider Commitment,  this is where Curie excelled. Her attitude is succinctly embodied in another of her quotes “I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done.”, She clearly had a goal and a belief in her ability to achieve it. Importantly,  she did whatever necessary to achieve that goal. The work was heavy and physically demanding – and involved danger. Pierre and Marie Curie carried out all of the work themselves processing tons of raw pitchblende – a highly radioactive material. Working very long hours,  they didn’t have a laboratory assistant until 3 years after winning the first Nobel Prize!, Of course,  when we consider Challenge,  as a genuine pioneer in her field,  facing significant opposition on numerous fronts,  she was clearly open to new ideas and to taking risks – and learning from their consequences,  good or bad. Marie Curie is famously quoted as saying “First principle: never to let one’s self be beaten down by persons or by events” and “Nothing in this world is to be feared… only understood. Now is the time to understand more,  so that we may fear less”. This attitude is a wonderful clear expression of the importance of being open to learning., Curie’s work ethic,  mindset and choices were underpinned by her Confidence in her own Abilities. She was a competent and talented scholar as evidenced by achieving the highest grades at school before entering University in Paris at 15 years of age. Being determined not to fall into teaching or becoming a governess as the only occupations available for professional women at that time,  Curie pursued Physics and Mathematical Sciences. She clearly valued challenging the status quo and committing her personal efforts to find solutions when she stated “Life is not easy for any of us. We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained”., Her Interpersonal Confidence was also a clear strength. She mixed freely with her contemporaries and earned their respect – again when it was unknown for women to offer and express ideas that challenged the beliefs and norms of the day. She was also a prolific writer., As in all case studies,  Marie Curie wasn’t perfect and just like any other human being she had her faults. Her single-mindedness led her to take risks. She eventually died from exposure to radiation. To this day her books and notes are locked in a lead case – being highly radioactive., She seemed to be incredibly self-aware and very reflective. These traits enabled her to develop a reputation for honesty and generosity. She gave away most of the money she received from the Nobel Prizes and insisted that any prizes be given to good causes., Nevertheless,  her Mental Toughness enabled her to achieve more significant outcomes during her research career than any of her peers. If Marie Curie was a man,  these achievements would still be remarkable because the world of science and innovation was and still is very much a man’s world. As a woman,  Curie had a harder path to tread but dealt with all of the biases,  barriers and injustices with remarkable poise., She was not averse to making impactful political gestures either. In her time Poland didn’t exist,  being part of three Empires. She named her first discovery Polonium in support of her dream of a free Polish state., Our colleague Prof Peter Clough often uses a phrase to describe what Mental Toughness brings to an individual. He describes it as “being comfortable in your own skin and dealing with what life throws at you and the opportunities that arise”. There may be no better example of this than Marie Curie., Mental Toughness describes the mindset that every person adopts in everything they do. It is closely related to qualities such as character,  resilience,  grit,  etc. Mental Toughness is defined as a personality trait which determines in large part how people deal with challenge,  stressors and pressure …. irrespective of prevailing circumstances., Finally,  again I need to own up. My mother,  a Pole,  perhaps for reasons now very obvious,  idolised Marie Curie. I paid little attention to that until recently. Belatedly,  researching this article became a pleasure and I found it more than a little inspirational., During the course of that research,  I came across another fascinating quote “The older one gets,  the more one feels that the present must be enjoyed; it is a precious gift,  comparable to a state of grace”. It seems that Marie Curie was paving the way for what we now refer to as Mindfulness too., If your interest is piqued to learn more about your own Mental Toughness profile an how to assess and develop Mental Toughness,  please visit www.aqrinternational.co.uk. and if interested in being a licensed user,  contact us through the site., Feel free to connect with me too on LinkedIn or via doug@aqr.co.uk, Special thanks are due to Lia Zalums who helped me to put this post together.

But,  though scientifically less fruitful,  her later years were in many ways the most eventful of her life., In, Marie Curie and Her Daughters,  Shelley Emling focuses on this later era in the great scientist’s life. It included a controversial love affair with physicist Paul Langevin,  a friendship with Albert Einstein,  the establishment of the Radium Institute in Paris,  her pioneering use of radiography on the French wounded in the first world war,  her tours of the United States to raise money to obtain radium for her institutes in Paris and Warsaw,  and her relationships with her daughters,  scientist Irène Joliot-Curie and writer Eve Curie., Science is not the strength of this book. Pierre Curie’s vital contribution and personality are rendered almost invisible,  and Emling says little about the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and the Curies in the 1890s – and botches the references she does make to the Curies’ legendary preparation of radium between 1899 and 1902., Advertisement, Still,  the book works well at a more personal level and inspires fresh admiration for Marie Curie’s dedication to science,  ethics and individuals,  particularly her two daughters. After working closely with her mother,  Irène went on to win a Nobel prize for her work on artificial radioactivity in 1935,  in collaboration with her own husband. Eve wrote a biography of her mother, Madame Curie,  which was a worldwide bestseller in the 1930s and was adapted to make a Hollywood feature film in 1943., Perhaps the most surprising part of the book,  though,  is to see how Curie’s welcome in the US in 1921 – by universities,  companies and public figures including US president Warren Harding – enabled her to shake off her dread of the spotlight. Wisely or not,  Marie and Pierre always refused on principle to patent any of their techniques,  and so their radium institutes were long deprived of resources. By her 1929 US tour,  she used her fame to help raise funds for her institutes’ research., Yet as this latest biography makes clear,  it never went to her head. As Einstein once remarked,  “Marie Curie is,  of all celebrated beings,  the only one whom fame has not corrupted.”, Marie Curie and Her Daughters: The private lives of science’s first family, Shelley Emling, Palgrave Macmillan, Topics:, nuclear technology, /, books and art, /, history, /, women in science, Advertisement, Sign up to our weekly newsletter, Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!, We'll also keep you up to date with, New Scientist, events and special offers., Sign up, More from, New Scientist, Explore the latest news,  articles and features, Humans, Ancient people of Easter Island made return trips to South America, News, Free, Health, How diseases like smallpox survived long ocean voyages, News, Subscriber-only, Humans, Nomads thrived in Greece after the collapse of the Roman Empire, News, Free, Environment, Tech firms claim nuclear will solve AI's power needs – they're wrong, Analysis, Subscriber-only, Popular articles, Trending, New Scientist, articles, 1, Light has been seen leaving an atom cloud before it entered, 2, What to know about the new covid-19 XEC variant, 3, A fresh understanding of OCD is opening routes to new treatments, 4, Evidence points to Wuhan market as source of covid-19 outbreak, 5, These maps will change how you see the world, 6, Most effective migraine drugs revealed by review of trial data, 7, Our reality seems to be compatible with a quantum multiverse, 8, Antarctica’s 'doomsday' glacier is heading for catastrophic collapse, 9, Can we solve quantum theory’s biggest problem by redefining reality?, 10, Ig Nobel prizes 2024: The unexpected science that won this year, Advertisement, Download the app, Find us on social media, Instagram, Facebook, X / Twitter, Tiktok, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Subscriptions, Subscriber benefits, Gift, Student & graduate, Educational, Corporate, Support, Contact us, Help, About us, Press room, Advertise, Write for us, Tools, Events, Science Jobs, CoLab, Syndication, RSS feeds, Legal and privacy, Complaint policy, Privacy policy, Cookie policy, Terms & conditions, Cookie Settings, © Copyright New Scientist Ltd., Back to the top"
