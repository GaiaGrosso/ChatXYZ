"(Wednesday Moraine: Ele mentary Particles; J.R.Oppenheimer presiainft) Hyperons! Oppenhelmer opened this session by remarking that there have been two questions which have been of unusually great help for us to talk ovœat these conferences. There has been on the one hand the general question of what truth there is, if any, in the Yukawa theory, and as to that we may have some intelligence this afternoon, and the question of how we can understand^ how properties of we can describe'the/particles which emerge in high energy en- counterSc It is/to that question that the principle part of this morning 5s session'will be devoted. It is of course manifest that we are-not very far in either program, but I believe hereof how very much more we know now than we did a few vears ago. It is onlv three vears ago that we could raise somewhat foggily the question of were there selection rules which accounted for the stability of these ©articles. It is on IV two -/ears ago that we noticed that rath r peculiar structuring of the mean lives of the particles between 10"" and 10"" 1 seconds. It is only last year that we were clear enough that the selection rules had some connection with isotopic spin, to be talking about charge doublets and charge triplets. And this year I think there is a new point which will come out, and that is that in addition to the charge degeneracy, there appear to be other degeneraciesj or quasi-degeneracies which do have a connection with the"
"year that we were clear enough that the selection rules had some connection with isotopic spin, to be talking about charge doublets and charge triplets. And this year I think there is a new point which will come out, and that is that in addition to the charge degeneracy, there appear to be other degeneraciesj or quasi-degeneracies which do have a connection with the theory of the stability of these particles, Rossi then presented a summary of the two cosmic ray sessions. He started with the tabular summary of the various particles as given on the previous page. There is first the well known particle which decays into a proton and a negative pion. The new information with regard to this particle which has come out in this meeting is a very precise measurement of the Q value from one event observed in photoplates at Bombay which gives 37.1 .3 Mev, There hasn't been any new information about the anomalous (high or low) 0 values reported by the California group, except that there are still two events which deviate considerably from this Q, and which might be explained by an alternative mode of decay into a proton, muon, and neutrino. There is a new precise measurement of the mean life from the Cal -13 Tech group which is 3.86 ,75 x 18 compared to the previous best value of 3.7 .6 .

There has been quite a bit of new information about this particle. There were previously only four events of. the-type 2*P*# observed in photoplates decaying at rest and giving a Q value of 116 £ g Mev. There are now two additional events from Bristol, two additional events from Padua, and one additional event from Ta ta; they all coincide with this 116 (also 2 from Wisconsin). With regard to the decay 2 + ntll , the data comes from photoplates. The particle decays sometimes ar rest, but very often in flight, so it is not possible to tell whether it Isa a % or a S- . The measurements are not as accurate as for the first mode of decay, except when the emitted particle comes to rest at the end of its range, and you don't have to estimate its energy.

But it is fairly sure now that this alternative mode of decay exists. As for the negative hyperon (2) before this meeting, there were only two events, of which I think only one was really good. They are from Shutt ' s group. During this meeting two more such events have been presented by Fretter, negative hyp irons that decay in flight in a cloud chamber. The Q value for this mode of decay seems to coincide with the Q value for the positive decay. There is also one decay in flight observed at Turin which is known to be negative since the pion makes a o~star. There is a new determination of the mean life • • • -1° from Bristol, giving it as shorted than 1&3 seconds. , There were previously five cases of the cascade particle with a Q value of about 60 Mev, I know of one more case presented at this meeting from Princeton wlicb gives a Q value of 59±6 Mev..

There was no new information on the alternative mode of decay into one charged and two neutral mesons, However one very interesting event has come from the Bombay groun in which the Q value appears to be much lower^and moreover the three particles are not coplanar. The neutral particle has its energy equal to its momentum, so it must be a massless particle, and it is reasonable to assume that it is a photon. There is a lifetime determination from Padua, where they found one case of a^meson decaying in flight in photoplates compared with ten cases of decay at rest, and elves about 5xl0~ 9 sec.

As to anomalous decays which don't fit this scheme, there are two possible interpretations. One is an alternate mode of decat of the 9° into ^f^t+V f and the other'is to postulate a neutral counterpart of the X decaying into U -fft .. The only new information which has come out in this meeting are t.vo new events from Indiana which fit either description, The majority of events available today could be asserted to be ft hut nor, all of them. Those that could not be X 0 could be :ê0-^ ff-f/^f Y. (Thomson noted that some could also be radiative decays.) Since some of the Q values are very low, Rossi believes a combination of these two exDlanations is probably required.Now I come to the really difficult part» These are trie charged heavy mesons that decay into a single charged particle.

First of all, what is the evidence for a two body decay with a pion secondary? There are two pieces of evidence, one coming from photoplates, and the othr from cloud chambers. The evidence from photoplates is not very abundant, but is rather convincing. There are thr-;e very good cases presented by the Padua group, one by th e Brookhaven group, and I am sure there are a few others around, in which the secondary particle is recog­ nized to be a pion. One case from tbe Tata group is particularly important, because the secondary particle is recognized to be a IFbecause it undergoes interaction in flight. In the. other cases the secondary particle is recognized to be a ^from grain counting and scattering. In these cases where the secondary particle is • surely a IT, and it is not of such low energy as to be applied to the alternate mode of decay of the the Q value appears to be unique. You"

In these cases where the secondary particle is • surely a IT, and it is not of such low energy as to be applied to the alternate mode of decay of the the Q value appears to be unique. You can also make a measurement of the primary mass, as hasbeen done by the Padua group, and if you compare the mass of the primary with the energy of the secondary, the neutral particle turns out to have a mass of 269±50, which makes it appear quite likely that it is a Jf*. The Q value is then very close to that for the 0°.The other piece of evidence comes from c loud chamber i:-,vii, the work with the multiplate chamber at MIT, and the work with the mae'net chamber at Princeton. The MÏT evidence is the fallowing. If one looks at particles which come to rest in one of the plates of the chamber, and if one looks at the secondary particles which come out, there is a group of such, secondary particles which stop at this range of about 60 gm/cm^ of lead. In all of these cases but one, there is an electron shower, which is not due to.a photon emitted .directly, because It dees not go in the opposite direction from the char°,«:o •> . > .iv*c?

The very strong evidence for the comes from the multiplate cloud chamber work at the Ecole Polytechnique and MIT, After some initial apparent discrepancies, the results of the two groups agree quite well. First of all, if one looks at par­ ticles which stop in the plates and looks at the secondaries, there is among the secondaries a group with a range of about 9 100 gm/cm of lead.

Whv do we say that the charged secondary is a jiA ? One should have seen at least five nuclear interactions at MIT if it were a^jF. Another argument is that the primary mass measurements (EP) are inconsistent with the secondary being •aTT. Why is the neutral partible a neutrino? Both a gamma ray and aff^ave ruled out because there are never gamma rays (I.S. showers) associated with the decav of K^, and they would certainly ha ve been s een if present. Also the mass argument again rules out the If , The mean life, according to estimates presented by LePrince-Ringuetjis of the order of 10~ tiseeonds. This is subject to some uncertainty, because the identity of the particles wMbh decay in flight is not always well known.

That it should be as highThere is essential!;/ no new information on the K There is no r ason to doubt its existence, since there are five or six cases of low energy 's stopping in emulsion. What makes it troublesome is that it appears ratter prominent!/ in photoplates, and we fail to see it in cloud chambers, at least if we look at particles which stop. Of course we would not get the low ©nergy mesons, because these wouid, for the most part, be absorbed in the plates. However, tne photoplate evidence seems to indicate that there are also mesons of higher energy which be seen in raultiplate chambers; of course only the low energy mesons are identified by decay in emulsion. But high r energy 5 s have be m identified by grain counting and scattering. It might be possible that the decay spectrum of this particle is very crouded toward the low energy end, so that the probability of detecting them in a cloud chamber is small.

One possibility leading to this woula be an alt amative mode of decay of the K going into The oth r possibility is that the mean life is too short or too long. If the lifetime were very short, you should see many decays in flight in the emulsions, which is not the case. Tf the life were of the order of several milliseconds, the cloud chamber would no longer be sensitive, and again it would not be seen, a rat bar strange possibility. I don't believe there is any direct as the f mass of job seems less likely after this me-.! ting than it did before. The difficulty with tr/ini to ret a precise value from the ranrte of the is (a) uncertainty in range duo to scattering in the plates, etc. and (b) uncertainty in the range- energy relation.

We have only to look at the , with the same decav products and lifetime as the ffmeson but an enormously greater energy release, to realize that we have no idea at present how to handle such a question. As to the K particle which decays into an electron ana two neutral secondaries, the conference has added quite a bit of new information. Before this conference there were to Rossi's knowledge only two, and now there are about seven such cases. There are three from Bristol giving a ^of 88, 49, and 81 Mev/c, two from Berkeley .with fj@of 56 and 110, and two from Rochester giving 'dpSof 20 and 2QI, One from Berkeley and one from Rochester are considered not completely sure, but very likely.

As to the X meson, Lenrlnco- Rlnguet has presented cloud chamber evidence showing that positives and negatives are about.equally abundant. Of eleven decays in flight, êii • are positive and five are negative. But the positive are all slow, and the negative are all, except one, fast; so there might be a different excitation curve for each. Also there might be a detection bias against the negatives. The situation with regard to charged hyperons is not clear. Both positive and negative hyperons are seen, but since there are two decay modes for the positive and only one for the negative, this might introduce a bias against the positives. Positive information comes from Cal Tech and is confirmed by Indiana to the effect that there are a large number of short lived negative particles.

The group at the Ecole Polytech­ nique find H2. positive K^and only one negative. But of the decays in flight which are certainly not hy perons, and can be either % or Kp t, there are equal numbers of positive and negative. This would seem to indicate that all the K^, are positive and' all the Kj^are negative; but the K^which decay at rest must be positive. On the basis of tnis rather contradictory evidence there must be both positive and negative . in these cases also, it appears that positives are much more abundant than negatives among the slow particles.

There are now a fairly large number of cases where a K particle undergoes some sort of nuclear interaction and emerges still as a K -particle; of course whether the identity of the K particle has changed is not known. There are two such events from Bristol, four from Tata, and one from Berkeley. Powell has one K particle which disappears in flight, and Salant has three which cause small stars in flight and/disappear. All this indicates a mean free path of nuclear dimensions. We already knew that when K come to rest they produce stars from which, very often, hvperons come ; out.

It is consis­ tent with either /\**0*4 X or + 2 with 2*-*A° 4K There are three events in which only the /\ is observed; all of these are abnormal in that the unobserved particle cannot be just a 0°. They can be eplained either by an additional if-ray, and additional jf? meson, or by the assumption that the/j comes from the decay of o a heavier hyperon. There are two cases where only the 9 is seen, one normal and one abnormal in the above sense. Thus there is good evidence for associated production in hydrogen. As to the production of charged particles in hydrogen, Shutt has three..cases of a charged .'hyperon and charged K meson; in one case the hyperon is negative, and tn the other two it could have either sign. There are many examples of double production in heavv elements, which are, of course, difficult to analyse so directly. But it may be significant that in.all cases where two particles are seen, they are a hyperon and a K meson. Another piece of indirect evi­ dence comes from the threshold for production (6f, Collins' report below). In nucléon-nucleus collisions, the energetic threshold corresponds to the production of a/1 and a K particle, not to the production of two f\ Is or a/\ and a hyperon. Shapiro noted,"

In the case of double production of a O Q A and a Q , the Princeton group find that when the decay plane of one of the particles makes a lagge angle with respect to the production plane, the decay plane ofl the other particle makes a small angle with respect to this plane.

(5 minute break)-^T4- Pais reported on views which have been expressed with regard to the new particles, especially, 0what is the source of their remarkable stability, how might one order their various decay schemes ? and how one might understand something about their pro­ duction, I will try to emphasize certain views which have been expressed by different people, in;.particular by Gell-Mann and myself (Pais), and which at first sight may seem to be contra­ dictory, but are, as a matter of fact, very intimately related. Of course the great question really is, what is a particle? I'don't think anyone will object if I say that a particle is characterized by mass and spin, which are the only properties we can define without talking about interaction. If we talk about interaction, the gross properties with which the experimentalists deal are its electric charge, the only charge which we know is conserved, its relative intrinsic parity, and its lifetime, Th^ question is if this list of entities is sufficient to lable a particle in a unique way.

"its lifetime, Th^ question is if this list of entities is sufficient to lable a particle in a unique way. To make a very broad distinction about ways of thought about the mew particles, one is ""are they c@mposites?""in a fairly A* conventional sense. For example, is the/] a bound system of a proton and a If*? If it is so that we have to deal with composites and can describe everything in terms of conventional quantum num~ bers and conventional dynamics, we are certainly dealing with unconventional values of quantum numbers. That is if the 4 is a îî'and a proton bound by an enormous potential barrier such that a ff""can come in at high energy,give up most of its energy in some way, and remain bound in a metastable state, the barrier has to be big for two reasons. In the first place you have to stabàlize against pion emission, and in the second place because you have to stabalize against gamma emission. The proposition as totheoretical views about this particle is always the simultaneous stability for these two processes. This idea of high angular momentum makes it extremely important to find out about the angular correlations. The experimental situation is unclear and this Question is still open. If you'have such high angular mom 5enta, than at not too high energy, you will also have the possibility of associated production. That is the system will want to emit two high angular momentum particles at a time so that they can compensate for each other,"
"to find out about the angular correlations. The experimental situation is unclear and this Question is still open. If you'have such high angular mom 5enta, than at not too high energy, you will also have the possibility of associated production. That is the system will want to emit two high angular momentum particles at a time so that they can compensate for each other, since the angular momentum in the beam itself Is not so large. The experiments in hydrogen at Brookhaven are consistent with associated production, but this does not mean that associated production always takes place» Hydrogen experiments with the Bevatron, where we are so far above threshold that such arguments cannot help us out any more, will settle the question at medium (4T5 Bev) energies. It is remarkable that no one nas yet seen the -productoin of two (\ 's, which has a low threshold, anl to which, from the point of view of angular momentum, there is no objection. Another point which I think quite important, is the question of the -f/- ratio.The situation is not clear, but perhaps Professor Rossi will not object if I say that at not too high energies the «f/- ratio is marked, and that at very high energies it tends much more toward unity, This' is really quite important from the point of view of composite theories, because if you use the nucléon-pion system to account for the new particles, and if you think this system is charge independent (certainly charge symmetric), it would be hard"
"at not too high energies the «f/- ratio is marked, and that at very high energies it tends much more toward unity, This' is really quite important from the point of view of composite theories, because if you use the nucléon-pion system to account for the new particles, and if you think this system is charge independent (certainly charge symmetric), it would be hard to get this marked asymmetry. Here one must be careful, because the a symmetry might be due to asymmetric initial conditions, rather than the nature of the interaction.-re­ pais knows of only one alternative to the composite system approach to the problem, where you have to deal with matrix elements which are steeply dependent on energy. In the other approach one says that there ate two basic interactions, ' sharply to be distinguished, a srtong production interaction and a weak decay interaction.' Stability then comes about by assuming that associated production- always takes place. This has certainly not been proved experimentally, and one counter­ example would be enough to disprove it ? but Pais feels the experimental situation is more encouraging than when he first suggested this idea. So associated production will be assumed in everything that follows. According to this view, the following reactions must be slow: The reactions which ma7 be fast are: The following things are to be noted about these reactions: (.1) The number of nucléons plus ^yperons id conserved.

You would lifee then to have further rules that would lead to more detailed predictions, and.'.•so on. In order to sketch what the situation may be, let me make a distinction between three groups of interactions, namely strong, electromagnetic, and weak. The stsong interactions comprise nuclear forces, new particle production, and hvperon bonding, and the weak ones are beta decay, muon decay, and the decay interactions of the new particles. We then have the following conservation laws; The attempt has been made to understand these stability laws for the new particles in terms of the more familiar, but also not understood law of charge independence. A couple of years ago I suggested that one could char­ acterize, the srong and weak interactions as even or odd, and itof dynamics by itroducing isotopic parity. This isotopia parity proved inadequate to stabilize enough particles. But here is the idea of assigning quantum numbers to particles and symmetry properties to.interactions. Then if the quantum numbers work out, you can ask where they come from. The idea behind all this is,to try'to see a connection between the stability laws, and the symmetry of the ""internal dynamics'«of. the particles."

The idea behind all this is,to try'to see a connection between the stability laws, and the symmetry of the ""internal dynamics'«of. the particles. Just as in atoms, where you have a very comnlcated structure with very many levels, there are a few levels which are metastable, due to the symmetry of the object ant the kind of interactions you allow the object to have. I will therefore sharply distinguish between the problem of stability, and the problem of predicting the masses. We may be in reach of attempting to predict stability; the mass problem is much more injtimtely connected with the dynamics? there may well be many more short .lived states we know nothing about. Now let me come to an attempt by- Gell-Mann of assigning quantum numbers to particles which seems to show promise. In the first place, what is charge independence in the conventional sense? One says that for the charge of the nucléon çsi- f ^, ù and that for the pion the charge Q ?L, This is not charge independence, but part of the game, for trivial reasons, because charge is absolutely conserved, and the total number of nucléons minus anti -nucléons is conserved, so that the è is also absolutely conserved.

It is therefore trivial to sav that I,.is conserved. Ù What is not trivial is that I 3 is the three component of an angular momentum I, and that I 2 is a good quantum number in interaction. The Gell-Mann idea is to relax the relation between Q and I-, in,a well defined way. This gives the following level, scheme for naryons.2* unstable against gamma decay to A (&9u for g m if4 * - p + p N f B allowed Note that the first time you can get a B"" you will also get a B.

"peculiar as a'hyperon. This is only terminology, but one should bear it in mind. Now comes the question, what id B? There we are, perhaps, in trouble. First of all, there are a great variety of K particles. We do not know how many of them are alternate decay modes of one kind of particle, but we do perhaps know (cf. Dalitz report below) that not all of them can be one kind of particle. That is, the tTand the 0 seem to have different space-time properties. Up till now, when we talked about multiplets, it was kind of tacitly understood that within a multiplet the only distinguishing feature was the charge. For example, if the charged mesons were pseudoscalar and the neutral meson scalar, you would say it was nonsense to talk about this thing as a triplet. But if , as appears likely, we are dealing with multiplets that are mysteriously degenerate, we have something very new to worry about. Oppenheimer noted that. you would probably want to say that particles with diff ,-rent lifetimes are not the same particle. o Pais commented that the 0- has about the same lifetime as the hyperons, which may be one reason why experimentally they are so often seen together.

Feynman remarked that two particles which are produced in associated •production ought not to have lifetimes which differ by many orders of magnitude, because they could then go backward through that strong interaction and come out the other side. But all the present experimental lifetimes are close enough so that this would not happen, Oppenheiiner noted that one might turn this argument around and say that this scheme of associated production has in it, also, the virtual explanation of the fact that the lifetimes fire -about the same, Dyson noted that there is nothing to prevent the from having a very different lifetime from the other hyperons• In worrying about what dynamics..,might be associated with' this set of quantum numbers, Pais noted that in decay we might have the selection rule -d.T^ for w eak interactions. This would then allow the cascade particle to decay to a fx but not to a neutron, (ïhen,^, would be long lived for the decay A +ÏÏ tod hard to detect), Gell-Mann noted that this might suggest the stronger rule ^i?, But what is behind this selection rule?

In the first place we noted that the center of gravity of the nucléon Q and I was displaced by | relative to the center of gravity of the pion Q and I. We-could do this freelv because the nucléons are conserved separately. This suggests that one mipht write down Q I 3+ K 3+ è for all the bar y on s, and Q «• I g + Kg for the bosons. That the £ is conserved is trivial since baryons are conserved. That Q. is conserved is trivial; this is just conservation of charge. Hence 'it is trivial that Ig+Kg is conserved. There are now two2 third component of the isotopic spin, where I is a good quantum number for strong interactions only, is not trivial. The second thing which is not trivial is that I s and and are conserved separately in strong and electromagnetic interactions. Note that if Alo 9*iï then AK^ ?? for weak interactions.

Therefore I v/a- lead to say that there is obviously another quantum number in this game, which I would like to attribute to certain state of angular momentum, or something, so that you know that it does belong here. The next point is that the isotopic spin for these various states is given integer and half-integer values. But you can easily convince yourself that if you have a particle which is capable 0f different states, that this particle cannot be allowed to have integer and half-integer states at the same time, as long as vou work with the three dimensional rotation group. This simply because the integr and hal-integer states are orthogonal to each other. This was proved by Paul! in Helvitia Physica Acta , 1939. Finally, I have been unable to construct an iteraction which carries away 4lg r*| This leads to the idea that the internal dynamics of these particles is a four-dimensional dynamics.

You can in fact prove that if K is to take both integral.and half- integral values, vou are forced into the four-dimensional space and...vou make I span the full unit sphere in r,he four-dimensional .Bnace. This is the ooint where the transition is made from three to four dimensions, because if that were not so it would be unnecessary to tall about four dimensiona. Very simply then, the model is the following. For spin $ particles, I replace L by L4 /2 *I and I keen K. Then T P is no longer equal to K w, as in the case with no spin, but le K*è. Then we can lable states by two quantum numbers (T,K).

Clearly we have all the particles we had before, but many others as well. This is the point which alwavs causes tremendous trouble, that is too much degeneracy and doubly charged particles. There is one way of getting out of this, which may not be the best way, whhich i , to say that the soectrum is split with respect to Kg. You might say that instead of a spherical top, we have a symmetrical top. This affects the doublv charged particles in the following way. There is an important limit in this game, which I call the first K particle limit. As soon as you have a mass greater than a nucléon plus a K narticle, you have to ask whether the narticle is stable against this decay.

They can be included into .the Gell-Mann scheme without introducing any doubly charged particles, but in Pais four-dimensional scheme their existence, would entail that of doubly charged particles as well. Collins then reported on an experiment which lends support to the Gell-Mann, Pais prediction that in nucléon-nucléon collisions you will produce a hyperon and a K meson but not two hyperons. The experimental arrangement is sketched below. Since the counter DETECTS gamma rays, this experiment is intended to pick UP the gammas arising from /F decay, where the Ji cannot have been produced in the target, but presumably comes from some heavy particle decay such as The counter is sensitive to gamma rays of an energy greater than about 30 Mev, and is rather insensitive to star products or charged particles in general.

The target can be moved back and forth thus varying the diatance from the target to the decay point seen by the counter. Starting with the decay POINT 5 cm from the target,, the number of counts falls to 1/e of its initial value when the target is muved upstream 2.5 cm. This is of the right order, since it corresponds to a decay lifetime of about -lP 10 second for a particle moving with the velocity of the center of mass in the nucleon-nucleon collision. If one now examines the variation of the number of counts with the energy of the protons incident on the target, one gets a typical threshold curve with both carbon and copper targets, the threshold being about 1.1 to 1,2 Bev. If one looks directlyone gets a very different excitation function, which Is one piece of evidence that the experiment is beim correctly inter­ preted* There is, of course, a finite chance that some subtle mistake is bein£ made.

In the first Place, there are a number of events in which the positive 7T.which is emitted is rather slow. If the spin and parity of the X meson were such that it could decay into two Ifmesons, then when it decays into three pions, the third pion cannot be at rest, because the angular momentum is the same, but the parity is opposite in the two situations, A more general statement of the same tyre is that in this case the probability density (square of the matrix element) in this diagram must vanish on the boundary, if the spin and parity of the X meson ar such that it can decay into two pions. This is emphasized in Figure a, which is a plot of the angle between the relative motion of the two Dositive mesons and the motion of the negative meson; in this diagram the density should vanish at cos Qsl.

But if the negative pion comes out in an S wave, the relative angular momentum of the (identical) positive pions must be even, and the spin of the t"" meson must be even and its parity odd. The evidence for this is plotted in Figure 3. It can be seen from these curves that this argument is not quite so strong as the first one. Again, however, isotropy is very reasonable, Figure 3 So for low spin values, it is very improbable that the % meson has a spin and parity such that it can decay into two pions.

His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity, . In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the, bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict., In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the, Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, . He lobbied for international control of, nuclear power, to avert, nuclear proliferation, and a, nuclear arms race, with the, Soviet Union, . He opposed the development of the, hydrogen bomb, during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the, second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the, Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his, security clearance, following a, 1954 security hearing, . This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist.

In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance., Early life, Childhood and education, Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer, [note 1], into a, non-observant Jewish, family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer., [5], [6], Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist., [7], Their father was born in, Hanau, then part of the, Hesse-Nassau province, of the, Kingdom of Prussia, and came to the United States as a teenager in 1888 with few resources and no money, higher education, or knowledge of the English language. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy., [8], In 1912, the family moved to an apartment on, Riverside Drive, near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses., [6], Their art collection included works by, Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and, Vincent van Gogh, ., [9], Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School.

In 1911, he entered the, Ethical Culture Society School, [10], founded by, Felix Adler, to promote training based on the, Ethical Culture, movement, whose motto was ""Deed before Creed"". Oppenheimer's father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its board of trustees., [11], Oppenheimer was a versatile student, interested in English and French literature, and particularly, mineralogy, ., [12], He completed third and fourth grades in one year and skipped half of eighth grade., [10], During his final year, Oppenheimer became interested in chemistry., [13], He graduated in 1921, but his further education was delayed a year by an attack of, colitis, contracted while, prospecting, in, Joachimstal, during a family vacation in, Czechoslovakia, . He recovered in, New Mexico, where he developed a love for horseback riding and the southwestern United States., [14], Oppenheimer entered, Harvard College, in 1922 at age 18. He majored in chemistry; Harvard also required studies in history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics.

"Harvard College, in 1922 at age 18. He majored in chemistry; Harvard also required studies in history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. To compensate for the delay caused by his illness, he took six courses each term instead of the usual four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society, Phi Beta Kappa, and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he could bypass basic courses in favor of advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on, thermodynamics, taught by, Percy Bridgman, . Oppenheimer graduated from Harvard in 1925 with a, Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only three years of study., [15], Studies in Europe, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, ' Laboratory in, Leiden, Netherlands, July 1927. Oppenheimer is in the middle row, second from the left., After being accepted at, Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1924, Oppenheimer wrote to, Ernest Rutherford, requesting permission to work at the, Cavendish Laboratory, though Bridgman's letter of recommendation said that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory suggested that theoretical, rather than experimental, physics would be his forte. Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge nonetheless;, [16], J. J. Thomson, ultimately accepted him on the condition that he complete a basic laboratory course., [17], Oppenheimer was very unhappy at Cambridge and wrote to a friend: ""I am having a pretty bad time.

The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything""., [18], He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, Patrick Blackett, a future Nobel laureate. According to Oppenheimer's friend, Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once confessed to leaving an apple injected with poison on Blackett's desk; no one ate it. Oppenheimer's parents convinced the university authorities not to press criminal charges or expel him. Instead Oppenheimer was placed on probation and had to have regular sessions with a psychiatrist in, Harley Street, London., [19], [20], [21], Oppenheimer was a tall, thin, chain smoker, [22], who often neglected to eat during periods of intense concentration. Many friends said he could be self-destructive. Fergusson once tried to distract Oppenheimer from his apparent depression by telling him that he (Fergusson) was to marry his girlfriend; Oppenheimer jumped on Fergusson and tried to strangle him. Oppenheimer was plagued by periods of depression throughout his life, [23], [24], and once told his brother, ""I need physics more than friends""., [25], In 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the, University of Göttingen, to study under, Max Born, ; Göttingen was one of the world's leading centers for theoretical physics.

Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including, Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, and, Edward Teller, . He was enthusiastic in discussion to the point of sometimes taking them over., [26], Maria Goeppert, presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said., [27], Oppenheimer obtained his, Doctor of Philosophy, degree in March 1927 at age 23, supervised by Max Born., [28], [29], After the oral exam, James Franck, the professor administering, reportedly said, ""I'm glad that's over. He was on the point of questioning, me, ."", [30], Oppenheimer published more than a dozen papers while in Europe, including many important contributions to the new field of quantum mechanics. He and Born published a famous paper on the, Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the mathematical treatment of molecules, allowing nuclear motion to be neglected to simplify calculations.

Bridgman also wanted him at Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in 1927 and Caltech in 1928., [32], At Caltech, he struck up a close friendship with, Linus Pauling, ; they planned to mount a joint attack on the nature of the, chemical bond, a field in which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results. The collaboration, and their friendship, ended after Oppenheimer invited Pauling's wife, Ava Helen Pauling, to join him on a tryst in Mexico., [33], Oppenheimer later invited Pauling to be head of the Chemistry Division of the, Manhattan Project, but Pauling refused, saying he was a pacifist., [34], In the autumn of 1928, Oppenheimer visited, Paul Ehrenfest, 's institute at the, University of Leiden, the"

There, he was given the nickname of, Opje, [35], later anglicized by his students as ""Oppie""., [36], From Leiden, he continued on to the, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), in Zurich to work with Wolfgang Pauli on, quantum mechanics, and the, continuous spectrum, . Oppenheimer respected and liked Pauli and may have emulated his personal style as well as his critical approach to problems., [37], On returning to the United States, Oppenheimer accepted an associate professorship from the, University of California, Berkeley, where, Raymond T. Birge, wanted him so badly that he expressed a willingness to share him with Caltech., [34], Before he began his Berkeley professorship, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with a mild case of, tuberculosis, and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at a New Mexico ranch, which he leased and eventually purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease, he exclaimed, ""Hot dog!"", and he later called it, Perro Caliente, (""hot dog"" in Spanish)., [38], Later, he used to say that ""physics and desert country"" were his ""two great loves"".,"

His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other as a pretentious and insecure poseur., [40], His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages., [41], Hans Bethe, said of him:, Probably the most important ingredient he brought to his teaching was his exquisite taste. He always knew what were the important problems, as shown by his choice of subjects. He truly lived with those problems, struggling for a solution, and he communicated his concern to the group.

"what were the important problems, as shown by his choice of subjects. He truly lived with those problems, struggling for a solution, and he communicated his concern to the group. In its heyday, there were about eight or ten graduate students in his group and about six Post-doctoral Fellows. He met this group once a day in his office and discussed with one after another the status of the student's research problem. He was interested in everything, and in one afternoon they might discuss quantum electrodynamics, cosmic rays, electron pair production and nuclear physics., [42], Oppenheimer worked closely with, Nobel Prize, -winning experimental physicist, Ernest O. Lawrence, and his, cyclotron, pioneers, helping them understand the data that their machines were producing at Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory, which eventually developed into today's, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ., [43], In 1936, Berkeley promoted him to full professor at an annual salary of $3, 300 (equivalent to $70, 000 in 2022). In return, he was asked to curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech., [44], Scientific work, Oppenheimer did important research in, theoretical astronomy, (especially as related to, general relativity, and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and, quantum field theory, including its extension into, quantum electrodynamics, .

The, formal mathematics, of, relativistic, quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, including the, neutron, meson, and, neutron star, ., [45], Initially, his major interest was the theory of the continuous spectrum. His first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its, transition probabilities, . He calculated the, photoelectric effect, for, hydrogen, and, X-rays, obtaining the, absorption coefficient, at the, K-edge, . His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the Sun, but not helium. Years later, it was realized that the Sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were correct., [46], [47], Oppenheimer made important contributions to the theory of, cosmic ray, showers. He also worked on the problem of, field electron emission, ., [48], [49], This work contributed to the development of the concept of, quantum tunneling, ., [50], In 1931, he co-wrote a paper, ""Relativistic Theory of the Photoelectric Effect"", with his student Harvey Hall, [51], in which, based on empirical evidence, he correctly disputed Dirac's assertion that two of the, energy levels, of the, hydrogen atom, have the same energy.

Subsequently, one of his doctoral students, Willis Lamb, determined that this was a consequence of what became known as the, Lamb shift, for which Lamb was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1955., [45], With, Melba Phillips, the first graduate student to begin her PhD under Oppenheimer's supervision, [note 2], Oppenheimer worked on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by, deuterons, . When, Ernest Lawrence, and, Edwin McMillan, bombarded, nuclei, with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of, George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory—subsequently known as the, Oppenheimer–Phillips process, —to explain the results. This theory is still in use today., [53], [note 3], As early as 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper that essentially predicted the existence of the, positron, . This was after a paper by Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, later known as the, Dirac equation, that unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron, spin, to explain the, Zeeman effect, ., [55], Drawing on the body of experimental evidence, Oppenheimer rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were,"

He argued that they would have to have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson, discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics., [56], In the late 1930s, Oppenheimer became interested in, astrophysics, most likely through his friendship with, Richard Tolman, resulting in a series of papers. In the first of these, ""On the Stability of Stellar Neutron Cores"" (1938), [57], co-written with, Robert Serber, Oppenheimer explored the properties of, white dwarfs, . This was followed by a paper co-written with one of his students, George Volkoff, ""On Massive Neutron Cores"", [58], which demonstrated that there was a limit, known as the, Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, to the mass of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as, neutron stars, and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, Oppenheimer and another of his students, Hartland Snyder, produced the paper "", On Continued Gravitational Contraction, "", [59], which predicted the existence of what later became termed, black holes, .

After the Born–Oppenheimer approximation paper, these papers remain his most cited, and were key factors in the rejuvenation of astrophysical research in the United States in the 1950s, mainly by, John A. Wheeler, ., [60], Oppenheimer's papers were considered difficult to understand even by the standards of the abstract topics he was expert in. He was fond of using elegant, if extremely complex, mathematical techniques to demonstrate physical principles, though he was sometimes criticized for making mathematical mistakes, presumably out of haste. ""His physics was good"", said his student Snyder, ""but his arithmetic awful""., [45], After, World War II, Oppenheimer published only five scientific papers, one of them in biophysics, and none after 1950., Murray Gell-Mann, a later Nobelist who, as a visiting scientist, worked with him at the, Institute for Advanced Study, in 1951, offered this opinion:, He didn't have, Sitzfleisch, ""sitting flesh, "" when you sit on a chair. As far as I know, he never wrote a long paper or did a long calculation, anything of that kind. He didn't have patience for that; his own work consisted of little, aperçus, but quite brilliant ones.

He claimed that he did not read newspapers or popular magazines and only learned of the, Wall Street crash of 1929, while he was on a walk with Ernest Lawrence six months after the crash occurred., [62], [63], He once remarked that he never cast a vote until the, 1936 presidential election, . From 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs. In 1934, he earmarked three percent of his annual salary—about $100 (equivalent to $2, 200 in 2022)—for two years to support German physicists fleeing, Nazi Germany, . During the, 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike, he and some of his students, including Melba Phillips and Bob Serber, attended a, longshoremen, 's rally. Oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to get Serber a position at Berkeley but was blocked by Berkeley Physics Department administrator Raymond T. Birge, who felt that "", one Jew in the department was enough, ""., [64], Oppenheimer's mother died in 1931, and he became closer to his father who, although still living in New York, became a frequent visitor in California.,"

Birge, who felt that "", one Jew in the department was enough, ""., [64], Oppenheimer's mother died in 1931, and he became closer to his father who, although still living in New York, became a frequent visitor in California., [65], When his father died in 1937, leaving $392, 602 (equivalent to $8 million in 2022) to be divided between Oppenheimer and his brother Frank, Oppenheimer immediately wrote out a will that left his estate to the University of California to be used for graduate scholarships., [66], Like many young intellectuals in the 1930s, Oppenheimer supported social reforms that were later categorized as, communist, ideas. He donated to many progressive causes considered, left-wing, during the, McCarthy era, . Most of his allegedly radical work consisted of hosting fundraisers for the, Republican, cause in the, Spanish Civil War, and other, anti-fascist, activity. He never openly joined the, Communist Party USA, (CPUSA), though he did give money to leftist causes by way of acquaintances who were alleged to be members., [67], When he joined the Manhattan Project in 1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he had been ""a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the, West Coast, ""., [68], Years later, he claimed that he did not remember saying this, that it was not true, and that if he had said anything along those lines, it was ""a"
"[67], When he joined the Manhattan Project in 1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he had been ""a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the, West Coast, ""., [68], Years later, he claimed that he did not remember saying this, that it was not true, and that if he had said anything along those lines, it was ""a half-jocular overstatement""., [69], He was a subscriber to the, People's World, [70], a Communist Party organ, and he testified in 1954, ""I was associated with the communist movement""., [71], From 1937 to 1942, Oppenheimer was a member at Berkeley of what he called a ""discussion group"", which was later identified by fellow members, Haakon Chevalier, [72], [73], and Gordon Griffiths as a ""closed"" (secret) unit of the Communist Party for Berkeley faculty., [74], The, FBI, opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941.

Almost all historians agree he had strong left-wing views during this time and interacted with party members, but it is disputed whether he was an official member. At his 1954 security clearance hearings, he denied being a member of the Communist Party but identified himself as a, fellow traveler, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of communism's goals but is not willing to blindly follow orders from any Communist Party apparatus., [80], Relationships and children, In 1936, Oppenheimer became involved with, Jean Tatlock, the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at, Stanford University School of Medicine, .

In 1938 she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, and in June 1939 moved with him to, Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the, University of California, Los Angeles, . She and Oppenheimer created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties, and in the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. When it was discovered she was pregnant, Kitty asked Harrison for a divorce, to which he acceded. On November 1, 1940, she obtained a quick divorce in, Reno, Nevada, and married Oppenheimer., [83], [84], Their first child, Peter, was born in May 1941, and their second, Katherine (""Toni""), was born in, Los Alamos, New Mexico, on December 7, 1944., [85], During his marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his affair with Tatlock., [86], Later, their continued contact became an issue in his security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's communist associations., [87],"

He was followed by Army security agents during a trip to California in June 1943 to visit Tatlock, who was suffering from, depression, . Oppenheimer spent the night in her apartment., [88], Tatlock killed herself on January 4, 1944, leaving Oppenheimer deeply grieved., [89], At, Los Alamos, Oppenheimer began an emotional affair with, Ruth Tolman, a psychologist and the wife of his friend Richard Tolman.

Actually, he was engaged in a very difficult calculation of the opacity of surfaces of stars to their internal radiation, an important constant in the theoretical construction of stellar models. He spoke little of these problems and seemed to be much more interested in literature, especially the Hindu classics and the more esoteric Western writers., Pauli, once remarked to me that Oppenheimer seemed to treat physics as an avocation and psychoanalysis as a vocation., —, I. I. Rabi, [92], Oppenheimer's diverse interests sometimes interrupted his focus on science.

He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was ... [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.... In Oppenheimer the element of earthiness was feeble. Yet it was essentially this spiritual quality, this refinement as expressed in speech and manner, that was the basis of his charisma. He never expressed himself completely.

On May 18, 1942, [112], National Defense Research Committee, Chairman, James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on, fast neutron, calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, Emil Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb., [113], [114], Oppenheimer's ID photo from the, Los Alamos Laboratory, In June 1942, the, U.S. Army, established the, Manhattan Engineer District, to handle its part in the atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the, Office of Scientific Research and Development, to the military., [115], In September, Brigadier General, Leslie R.

Groves worried that because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists, [119], but Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a, military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, and, engineering, . Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an ""overweening ambition"", [120], which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion., [120], Oppenheimer's past associations were not overlooked, but on July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security clearance ""without delay irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr Oppenheimer.

On November 16, 1942, he, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he knew well: a flat, mesa, near, Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was the site of a private boys' school, the, Los Alamos Ranch School, . The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply but otherwise felt that it was ideal., [123], The, Los Alamos Laboratory, was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings were erected in great haste. At the laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top physicists of the time, whom he called the ""luminaries""., [124], Los Alamos was initially supposed to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army.

He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at 128 pounds (58 kg), diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis, and were concerned about his chronic, lumbosacral joint, pain., [125], The plan to commission scientists fell through when Rabi and, Robert Bacher, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the University of California operated the laboratory under contract to the, War Department, ., [126], It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project: Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6, 000 in 1945., [125], Oppenheimer at first had difficulty with the organizational division of large groups but rapidly learned the art of large-scale administration after he took up permanent residence at Los Alamos. He was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and the military., Victor Weisskopf, wrote:, Oppenheimer directed these studies, theoretical and experimental, in the real sense of the words.

Here his uncanny speed in grasping the main points of any subject was a decisive factor; he could acquaint himself with the essential details of every part of the work., He did not direct from the head office. He was intellectually and physically present at each decisive step. He was present in the laboratory or in the seminar rooms, when a new effect was measured, when a new idea was conceived. It was not that he contributed so many ideas or suggestions; he did so sometimes, but his main influence came from something else. It was his continuous and intense presence, which produced a sense of direct participation in all of us; it created that unique atmosphere of enthusiasm and challenge that pervaded the place throughout its time., [127], Bomb design, Leslie Groves, military head of the Manhattan Project, with Oppenheimer in 1942, At this point in the war, there was considerable anxiety among the scientists that the, German nuclear weapons program, might be progressing faster than the Manhattan Project., [128], [129], In a letter dated May 25, 1943, Oppenheimer responded to a proposal by Fermi to use radioactive materials to poison German food supplies.

Oppenheimer continued, ""I think we should not attempt a plan unless we can poison food sufficient to kill a half a million men""., [130], In 1943, development efforts were directed to a, plutonium, gun-type fission weapon, called "", Thin Man, "". Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated, plutonium-239, which was extremely pure but could be created only in tiny amounts. When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the, X-10 Graphite Reactor, in April 1944, a problem was discovered: reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of, plutonium-240, making it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon., [131], In July 1944, Oppenheimer abandoned the gun design in favor of an, implosion-type, weapon. Using chemical, explosive lenses, a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form. The metal needed to travel only very short distances, so the critical mass would be assembled in much less time., [132], In August 1944, Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion., [133], He concentrated the development efforts on the gun-type device, a simpler design that only had to work with, uranium-235, in a single group.

The Interim Committee established a scientific panel consisting of Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton, Fermi, and Lawrence to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the panel offered its opinion not just on an atomic bomb's likely physical effects but also on its likely military and political impact., [137], This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan., [138], Trinity, Main article:, Trinity (nuclear test), The, Trinity test, was the first detonation of a nuclear device., [139], In the early morning hours of July 16, 1945, near, Alamogordo, New Mexico, the work at Los Alamos culminated in the test of the world's first, nuclear weapon,"

Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds."", [146], In 1965 he recalled the moment this way:, We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent.

He expressed regret that the weapon was ready too late for use against Nazi Germany., [156], On August 17, however, Oppenheimer traveled to Washington to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned., [157], In October he met with President, Harry S. Truman, who dismissed Oppenheimer's concern about an arms race with the, Soviet Union, and belief that atomic energy should be under international control. Truman became infuriated when Oppenheimer said, ""Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands"", responding that he (Truman) bore sole responsibility for the decision to use atomic weapons against Japan, and later said, ""I don't want to see that son of a bitch in this office ever again""., [158], [159], For his services as director of Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was awarded the, Medal for Merit, by Truman in 1946., [160], Postwar activities, Once the public learned of the Manhattan Project after the bombings"

His art collection included works by, Cézanne, Derain, Despiau, de Vlaminck, Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, Van Gogh and Vuillard., [170], Oppenheimer brought together intellectuals at the height of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including, Freeman Dyson, and the duo of, Chen Ning Yang, and, Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of, parity, non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as, T. S. Eliot, and, George F. Kennan, .

Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities., [171], During a series of conferences in New York from 1947 through 1949, physicists transitioned from war work back to theoretical issues. Under Oppenheimer's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problem of the pre-war years: infinite, divergent, and seemingly nonsensical expressions in the quantum electrodynamics of, elementary particles, ., Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and, Shin'ichiro Tomonaga, tackled the problem of, regularization, and developed techniques that became known as, renormalization, . Freeman Dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of meson absorption and, Hideki Yukawa, 's theory of mesons as the carrier particles of the, strong nuclear force, were also tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted, Robert Marshak, 's innovative two-meson, hypothesis, : that there are actually two types of mesons, pions, and, muons, . This led to, Cecil Frank Powell, 's breakthrough and subsequent Nobel Prize for the discovery of the pion., [172], [note 6], Oppenheimer served as director of the institute until 1966, when he gave up the position due to his failing health., [174], As of 2023, [update], he is the longest-serving director of the institute., [175], Atomic Energy Commission,"

In this report, the committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production., Bernard Baruch, was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the, Baruch Plan, of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. It was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, [176], which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust., [177], After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons"

From this position, he advised on a number of nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded., [178], As chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race., [179], The, first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union, in August 1949 came earlier than Americans expected, and over the next several months, there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities over whether to proceed with the development of the far more powerful, nuclear fusion, -based, hydrogen bomb, then known as ""the Super""., [180], Oppenheimer had been aware of the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon since the days of the Manhattan Project and had allocated a limited amount of theoretical research work toward the possibility at the time, but nothing more than that, given the pressing need to develop a fission weapon., [181], Immediately following the end of the war, Oppenheimer argued against continuing work on the"
"[180], Oppenheimer had been aware of the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon since the days of the Manhattan Project and had allocated a limited amount of theoretical research work toward the possibility at the time, but nothing more than that, given the pressing need to develop a fission weapon., [181], Immediately following the end of the war, Oppenheimer argued against continuing work on the Super at that time, due to both lack of need and the enormous human casualties that would result from its use., [182], [183], Now in October 1949, Oppenheimer and the GAC recommended against the development of the Super., [184], He and the other GAC members were motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be strategically used, resulting in millions of deaths: ""Its use therefore carries much further than the atomic bomb itself the policy of exterminating civilian populations""., [185], They also had practical qualms, as there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb at the time., [186], Regarding the possibility of the Soviet Union developing a thermonuclear weapon, the GAC felt that the United States could have an adequate stockpile of atomic weapons to retaliate against any thermonuclear attack., [187], In that connection, Oppenheimer and the others were concerned about the, opportunity costs, that would be incurred if nuclear reactors were diverted from materials needed for atom bomb production to the materials such as, tritium, needed for a thermonuclear weapon., [188], [189], A majority of the AEC subsequently endorsed the GAC recommendation, and Oppenheimer thought that"

It was therefore possible to argue also that you did not want it even if you could have it. The program in 1951 was technically so sweet that you could not argue about that. The issues became purely"

It was therefore possible to argue also that you did not want it even if you could have it. The program in 1951 was technically so sweet that you could not argue about that. The issues became purely the military, the political and the humane problem of what you were going to do about it once you had it., [197], Oppenheimer, Conant, and, Lee DuBridge, another member who had opposed the H-bomb decision, left the GAC when their terms expired in August 1952., [198], Truman had declined to reappoint them, as he wanted new voices on the committee who were more in support of H-bomb development., [199], In addition, various opponents of Oppenheimer had communicated to Truman their desire that Oppenheimer leave the committee., [200], Panels and study groups, The 1946, Los Alamos, colloquium on the, Super, .

When pressed on the issue in later interviews, Oppenheimer admitted that the only person who had approached him was his friend, Haakon Chevalier, a Berkeley professor of French literature, who had mentioned the matter privately at a dinner at Oppenheimer's house., [228], The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with evidence that intimated communist ties. These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier. Strauss had expressed opposition to exporting radioactive isotopes to other nations, and Oppenheimer had called them ""less important than electronic devices but more important than, let us say, vitamins""., [229], On June 7, 1949, Oppenheimer testified before the, House Un-American Activities Committee, that he had associations with the Communist Party USA in the 1930s., [230], He testified that some of his students, including, David Bohm, Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz, Philip Morrison, Bernard Peters, and, Joseph Weinberg, had been communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley.

Unable to find work in physics for many years, he became a, cattle rancher, in, Colorado, . He later taught high school physics and was the founder of the San Francisco, Exploratorium, ., [79], [231], The triggering event for the security hearing happened on November 7, 1953, [232], when, William Liscum Borden, who until earlier in the year had been the executive director of the, United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, sent Hoover a letter saying that ""more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union""., [233], Eisenhower never exactly believed the allegations in the letter but felt compelled to move forward with an investigation, [234], and on December 3, he ordered that a ""blank wall"" be placed between Oppenheimer and any government or military secrets., [235], On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning by way of requesting termination of his consulting contract with the AEC., [236], Oppenheimer chose not"

Nichols, general manager of the AEC., [238], [239], Nichols wrote that he was ""not happy with the inclusion of a reference concerning Oppenheimer's opposition to the hydrogen bomb development."", [240], He considered that ""in spite of his record he is loyal to the United States."", [241], The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was held in secret, focused on Oppenheimer's past communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or communist scientists., [242], It then continued with an examination of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb and stances in subsequent projects and study groups., [243], A transcript of the hearings was published in June 1954, [244], with some redactions.

Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime., [248], Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal to the U.S. government, but that:, In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act—I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted—in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand.

To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more. In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands., [249], Teller's testimony outraged the scientific community, and he was virtually ostracized from academic science., [250], Ernest Lawrence refused to testify, pleading an attack of ulcerative colitis, but an interview in which Lawrence condemned Oppenheimer was submitted in evidence., [251], Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Physicist, Isidor Isaac Rabi, said that the suspension of the security clearance was unnecessary: ""he is a consultant, and if you don't want to consult the guy, you don't consult him, period."", [252], But Groves testified that, under the stricter security criteria in effect in 1954, he ""would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today""., [253], At the conclusion of the hearings, the board revoked Oppenheimer's clearance by a 2–1 vote., [254], It unanimously cleared him of disloyalty, but a majority found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially"

He did not comment on Oppenheimer's loyalty., [257], During his hearing, Oppenheimer testified willingly on the left-wing activities of many of his colleagues. Had his clearance not been stripped, he might have been remembered as someone who ""named names"" to save his own reputation, [258], but as it happened, most in the scientific community saw him as a martyr to McCarthyism, an eclectic liberal unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific work from academia into the military., [259], Wernher von Braun, told a Congressional committee: ""In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted""., [260], In a seminar at, The Wilson Center, in 2009, based on an extensive analysis of the, Vassiliev notebooks, taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and,"

Schmitz's decision caused an uproar among the students; 1, 200 of them signed a petition protesting the decision, and Schmitz was, burned in effigy, . While they marched in protest, the state of Washington outlawed the Communist Party, and required all government employees to swear a, loyalty oath, ., Edwin Albrecht Uehling, the chairman of the physics department and a colleague of Oppenheimer's from Berkeley, appealed to the university senate, and Schmitz's decision was overturned by a vote of 56 to 40.

He joined with, Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat, and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually, in 1960, become the, World Academy of Art and Science, . Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the, Russell–Einstein Manifesto, of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first, Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, in 1957., [275], In his speeches and public writings, Oppenheimer continually stressed the difficulty of managing the power of knowledge in a world in which the freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer delivered the, Reith Lectures, on the, BBC, in 1953, which were subsequently published as, Science and the Common Understanding, ., [276], In 1955, Oppenheimer published, The Open Mind, a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 on the subject of nuclear weapons and popular culture., [277], Oppenheimer rejected the idea of nuclear, gunboat diplomacy, .

At the event, AEC chairman, Glenn Seaborg, asked Oppenheimer whether he wanted another security hearing. Oppenheimer declined., [287], In March 1963, the General Advisory committee of the AEC selected Oppenheimer to receive its, Enrico Fermi Award, an award Congress had created in 1954., [287], Kennedy was assassinated, before he could present the award to Oppenheimer, but his successor, Lyndon Johnson, did so in a December 1963 ceremony at which he cited Oppenheimer's ""contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, [and] leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years""., [288], He called the signing of the award one of Kennedy's greatest acts as president., [289], Oppenheimer told Johnson, ""I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has"

"dilemmas of moral responsibility presented by science in the nuclear age., [300], The hearings were motivated by politics and personal enmities, and reflected a stark divide in the nuclear weapons community., [301], One group passionately feared the Soviet Union as a mortal enemy, and believed having the most powerful weaponry capable of providing the most massive retaliation was the best strategy to combat that threat. The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not improve Western security and that, using the weapon against large civilian populations, would be, genocide, ; they advocated instead a more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control agreements. The first of these groups was the more powerful in political terms, and Oppenheimer became its target., [302], [303], Rather than consistently oppose the ""Red-baiting"" of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against former colleagues and students, before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end, it became a liability when it became clear Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters's loyalty, and recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory., [304], Popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized"

All these, in different ways, were turned against him in the hearings."", [308], The question of scientists' responsibility toward humanity inspired, Bertolt Brecht, 's drama, Life of Galileo, (1955), left its imprint on, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, 's, The Physicists, and is the basis of, John Adams, 's 2005 opera, Doctor Atomic, which was commissioned to portray Oppenheimer as a modern-day, Faust, .

After reading a transcript of Kipphardt's play soon after it began to be performed, Oppenheimer threatened to sue Kipphardt, decrying ""improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved""., [311], Later Oppenheimer told an interviewer:, The whole damn thing [his security hearing] was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it. ...

The Army component was designated the, Manhattan District, as its first headquarters were in, Manhattan, ; the name gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. The project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys, . The Manhattan Project grew rapidly and employed nearly 130, 000 people at its peak and cost nearly US$2 billion (equivalent to about $24 billion in 2021)., [1], Over 90 percent of the cost was for building factories and to produce, fissile material, with less than 10 percent for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada., The project led to the development of two types of atomic bombs, both developed concurrently, during the war: a relatively simple, gun-type fission weapon, and a more complex, implosion-type nuclear weapon, . The, Thin Man, gun-type design proved impractical to use with, plutonium, so a simpler gun-type design called, Little Boy, was developed that used, uranium-235, .

In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at, Bikini Atoll, as part of, Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of, national laboratories, supported medical research into, radiology, and laid the foundations for the, nuclear navy, . It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the, United States Atomic Energy Commission, (UNAEC) in January 1947., Origins, For a chronological guide, see, Timeline of the Manhattan Project, ., The, discovery of nuclear fission, by German chemists, Otto Hahn, and, Fritz Strassmann, in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by, Lise Meitner, and, Otto Frisch, made the development of an, atomic bomb, a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a, German atomic bomb project, would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from, Nazi Germany, and other, fascist, countries., [2], In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists, Leo Szilard, and, Eugene Wigner, drafted the, Einstein–Szilard letter, which warned of the potential development of ""extremely powerful bombs of a new type"".

He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as advanced., [17], As part of the scientific exchange, the MAUD Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist, Mark Oliphant, flew to the US in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the MAUD Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited, Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to, Ernest O. Lawrence, . Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to, James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton, and, George B. Pegram, .

The scientists at the July 1942 Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from, cyclotrons, ., [30], Even by December 1943, only two milligrams had been produced., [31], There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a ""cylindrical plug"" into a sphere of ""active material"" with a ""tamper""—dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency., [32], They also explored designs involving, spheroids, a primitive form of "", implosion, "" suggested by, Richard C.

The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs., [35], Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might ""ignite"" the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei., [note 2], Bethe calculated that it could not happen, [37], and a report co-authored by Teller showed that ""no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started."", [38], In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned the possibility of this scenario to, Arthur Compton, who ""didn't have enough sense to shut up about it.

The first step was to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel, Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose., [48], Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania., [49], Military Policy Committee, Oppenheimer, and Groves at the remains of the, Trinity test, in September 1945, two months after the test blast and just after the end of World War II.

Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority""., [59], One of Groves' early problems was to find a director for, Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts.

However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were, communists, including his wife, Kitty, ; his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock, ; and his brother, Frank, . A long conversation in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943., [60], [61], Collaboration with the United Kingdom, Main article:, British contribution to the Manhattan Project, The British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts.

In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the nuclear bombing of Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee., [75], The Combined Policy Committee created the, Combined Development Trust, in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure uranium and, thorium ores, on international markets. The, Belgian Congo, and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the, Belgian Government in Exile, was in London.

However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant., [139], In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee., [140], Research into the centrifuge method advanced significantly after the war with the introduction of the, Zippe-type centrifuge, which was developed in the Soviet Union by Soviet and captured German engineers., [141], It eventually became the preferred method of uranium isotope separation, being far more economical., [142], Electromagnetic separation, Main article:, Y-12 Project, Electromagnetic isotope separation was developed at the University of California Radiation Laboratory.

"The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient., [145], Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity., [143], Alpha I racetrack at Y-12, Marshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require 5, 000 short tons (4, 500 tonnes) of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 copper:silver ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with, Under Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel W. Bell, and asked for the transfer of 6, 000 tons of silver bullion from the, West Point Bullion Depository, ., [146], Ultimately 14, 700 short tons (13, 300 tonnes; 430, 000, 000 troy ounces) were used., [147], The 1, 000-troy-ounce (31 kg) silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets, extruded into strips, and wound onto magnetic coils., [147], [148], The, Calutron Girls, were young women who monitored calutron control panels at Y-12.

The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943., [150], The second Alpha I was operational at the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944., [151], Tennessee Eastman, was contracted to manage Y-12., [152], The calutrons were turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators known as the, Calutron Girls, ., [153], The calutrons initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5, 825 of the uranium feed emerged as product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945.

In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant, and the next month they received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August, K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks., [154], Gaseous diffusion, Main article:, K-25, The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion., Graham's law, states that the rate of, effusion, of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its, molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen, and, John R. Dunning, ., [155], Oak Ridge K-25 plant, In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant., [156], On 14 December, M. W.

Kellogg, accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project., [157], The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps had to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which had to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the, Bell Telephone Laboratories, and the, Bakelite, Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production., [158], [159], Kellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story 0.5-mile (0.80 km) long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections containing cells of six stages. A survey party began construction by marking out the 500-acre (2.0 km, 2, ) site in May 1943.

Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, Union Carbide, and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480 million., [160], The production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2, 892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants., [161], Thermal diffusion, Main article:, S-50 Project, The thermal diffusion process was based on, Sydney Chapman, and, David Enskog, 's, theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one"

This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part., [163], The Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when, Captain, William S. Parsons, the naval officer in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer informed Groves, who approved construction of a thermal plant on 24 June 1944., [164], The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smoke stacks)., Groves contracted with the H.

Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (690 kPa) and temperature of 545 °F (285 °C), flowed downward through the innermost 1.25-inch (32 mm) nickel pipe, while water at 155 °F (68 °C) flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. The uranium hexafluoride flowed in the middle copper pipe, and isotope separation of the uranium occurred between the nickel and copper pipes., [166], Work commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 the S-50 plant produced 12, 730 pounds (5, 770 kg) of slightly enriched product., [167], By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching the uranium from 0.71% to 0.89% uranium-235. This was then fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. In turn, this was fed into Y-12, [168], which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for use in nuclear weapons. About 50 kilograms (110"

Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities is via a reactor.

Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot., [171], The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, 24 feet (7.3 m) per side, weighing around 1, 500 short tons (1, 400 t), surrounded by 7 feet (2.1 m) of high-density concrete as a radiation shield., [171], The greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a, hot dipping process, without success., Alcoa, tried canning, developing a new process for flux-less welding; 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%.

They were, pickled, to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and, aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using, arc welding, under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were tested to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start, Reactor B, on schedule in August 1944., [177], Work began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250 MW reactors, on 10 October 1943., [178], The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites developed first, as this maximized the distance between the reactors.

Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the, control rods, to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination.

The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%., [174], At Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials., [189], Early plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East., [190], Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or ""canyon"" (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231)"

The canyons were each 800 feet (240 m) long and 65 feet (20 m) wide.

The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945.

A higher-velocity gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was also considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238., [195],"

Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. The critical mass is assembled in much less time than with the gun method. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, [196], so it also makes more efficient use of the fissionable material., [197], Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations showed promise, but also made it clear that an implosion weapon was more complex than the gun-type design from both a theoretical and an engineering perspective., [198], In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with, shaped charges, proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on., [199], An implosion-type nuclear bomb, An accelerated effort on the implosion design, codenamed, Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion., [200], Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives)"

To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of neutron-absorbing boron., [205], A polonium-beryllium, modulated neutron initiator, known as an ""urchin"", [209], was developed to start the chain reaction at precisely the right moment., [210], This work on the chemistry and metallurgy of radioactive polonium was directed by, Charles Allen Thomas, of the, Monsanto Company, and became known as the, Dayton Project, ., [211], Testing required up to 500, curies, per month of polonium, which Monsanto was able to deliver., [212], The whole assembly was encased in a, duralumin, bomb casing to protect it from bullets"

The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was suspected, but it was soon determined that there were multiple, allotropes of plutonium, ., [213], The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300 °C to 450 °C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with, alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon using a, plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be, hot pressed, into the desired spherical shape.

By the end of the war, half the chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element was detected in their urine., [215], A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site., [216], The hemispheres for the first plutonium, pit, (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later., [217], In contrast to the plutonium Fat Man, the uranium gun-type Little Boy weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design.

It was fabricated at great expense from 214 short tons (194 t) of iron and steel., [225], By the time it arrived, however, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower 800 yards (730 m) from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be.

The shock wave was felt over 100 miles (160 km) away, and the, mushroom cloud, reached 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in height.

As construction activity declined, the workforce fell to 100, 000 a year later, but the number of military personnel increased to 5, 600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult., [234], Due to high turnover, over 500, 000 people worked on the project., [235], In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the, War Manpower Commission, . In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority., [236], The Kansas commission director stated that from April to July 1944 every qualified applicant in the state who visited a, United States Employment Service, office was urged to work at the Hanford Site.

Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work., [238], One source of skilled personnel was the Army itself, particularly the, Army Specialized Training Program, . In 1943, the MED created the, Special Engineer Detachment, (SED), with an authorized strength of 675. Technicians and skilled workers drafted into the Army were assigned to the SED.

Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos., [241], The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials., [242], Yet in December 1945, the, National Safety Council, presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record.

In April 1942 nuclear physicist, Georgy Flyorov, wrote to, Josef Stalin, on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project., [250], The Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project., [251], The Office of Censorship relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office.

"Q clearance, being revoked. This marked the end of his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-communist, McCarthyism, ., Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated back to the 1930s, when he was a member of numerous, Communist front, organizations, and was associated with, Communist Party USA, members, including his wife, brother and sister-in-law. These associations were known to, Army Counterintelligence, at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity, Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the, hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner, Lewis Strauss, ., The proceedings were initiated after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily give up his security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire at the end of June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two-to-one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire.

As a result of the two-to-one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated., The loss of his security clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations of those who had testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, though Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents, John F. Kennedy, and, Lyndon B. Johnson, . The brief period when scientists were viewed as a ""public policy priesthood"" ended, and thereafter would serve the state only to offer narrow scientific opinions. Scientists working in government were on notice that, dissent, was no longer tolerated., The fairness of the proceedings has been a subject of controversy, and on December 16, 2022, United States Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, nullified the 1954 decision, saying that it had been the result of a ""flawed process"" and affirming that Oppenheimer had been loyal., Background, [, edit, ], Before, World War II, J.

In a 1930 paper on the, Dirac equation, he had predicted the existence of the, positron, . A 1938 paper co-written with, Robert Serber, explored the properties of, white dwarf, stars. This was followed by one co-written with one of his students, George Volkoff, in which they demonstrated that there was a limit, the so-called, Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, to the, mass, of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as, neutron stars, and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, with another of his students, Hartland Snyder, he went further and predicted the existence of what are today known as, black holes, .

Lawrence, who was awarded the, Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1939 for his invention of the, cyclotron, . But as an experimental physicist, Lawrence had come to rely on Oppenheimer, [7], [8], and it was Lawrence who brought Oppenheimer into the effort to develop an, atomic bomb, which became known as the, Manhattan Project, ., [9], Brigadier General, Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who became director of the Manhattan Project on September 8, 1942, met Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where Oppenheimer briefed Groves on the work done so far on the "", Super, "" (thermonuclear) bomb. Oppenheimer told Groves on October 8 that the Manhattan Project needed a dedicated weapons development laboratory.

Oppenheimer became a celebrity, with his face gracing front pages of newspapers and the covers of magazines., [12], Life, magazine described him as ""one of the most famous men in the world, one of the most admired, quoted, photographed, consulted, glorified, well-nigh deified as the fabulous and fascinating archetype of a brand new kind of hero, the hero of science and intellect, originator and living symbol of the new atomic age."", [13], Chevalier incident, [, edit, ], Many of Oppenheimer's associates in the years before World War II were, Communist Party USA, members.

Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the, American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a, Communist front, .

Chevalier told Oppenheimer that there was a scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the, Soviet Union, ., [17], Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for, Shell Oil, and who had, Communist, connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank., [18], In any case, Groves had considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over any suspicious behavior. He had ordered on July 20, 1943 that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance ""without delay, irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer.

He related the ""Chevalier incident"", and he gave contradictory and equivocating statements, telling government agents that only he had been approached, by Chevalier, who at the time had supposedly said that he had a potential conduit through Eltenton for information which could be passed to the Soviets. Oppenheimer claimed to have invented the other contacts to conceal the identity of Chevalier, whose identity he believed would be immediately apparent if he named only one contact, but whom he believed to be innocent of any disloyalty. The 1943 fabrication and the shifting nature of his accounts figured prominently in the 1954 inquiry., [20], [21], The, McMahon Act, that established the, Atomic Energy Commission, (AEC) required all employees holding wartime security clearances issued by the Manhattan Project to be investigated by the, FBI, and re-certified., [22], This provision had come in the wake of the February 16, 1946 announcement in Canada of the arrest of 22 people exposed as a consequence of the defection the previous September of Soviet cipher clerk, Igor Gouzenko, ., [23], President, Harry S.

These included, Lewis Strauss, [28], an AEC commissioner who resented Oppenheimer for his humiliation before Congress regarding opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, which Strauss believed had military applications. As GAC chairman, Oppenheimer was called before the, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, (JCAE) over the issue in June 1949.

You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do. You can use a bottle of beer for atomic energy, in fact you do. But to get some perspective, the fact is that during the war and after the war these materials played no significant part, and in my knowledge, no part at all ... My own rating of the importance of isotopes in this broad sense is that they are far less important than electronic devices but far more important than, let us say, vitamins, somewhere in between., [30], This came on the heels of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, including, David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz, and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley.

In 1949, the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb. This came as a shock to many Americans, and it fell to Oppenheimer to play a leading role in checking the evidence and confirming that the explosion had taken place., [35], In response, Strauss recommended that the United States retain nuclear superiority by developing the ""Super""., [36], This had been under consideration at Los Alamos for several years. Brigadier General, James McCormack, told the AEC commissioners that while thermonuclear weapons could potentially be thousands of times as powerful as fission weapons, as of 1949 there was no design that worked, and no certainty that a practical bomb could be built if there was one. He cautioned that the ""Super"" would probably require large amounts of, tritium, which could only be acquired by diverting the AEC's, nuclear reactors, from, plutonium, production., [37], Strauss found allies in Lawrence and, Edward Teller, who had headed the ""Super"" group at Los Alamos during the war., [38], When the matter was referred to the GAC, it unanimously voted against a, crash program, to develop the ""Super"".

In projects and study groups such as, Project Vista, and the, Lincoln Summer Study Group, however, Oppenheimer pushed for smaller ""tactical"" nuclear weapons that would be more useful against enemy troops in a limited theater conflict and which would be under control of the Army.

In the letter, Borden stated his opinion ""based upon years of study, of the available classified evidence, that more probably than not J.

The letter concluded:, 1. Between 1939 and mid-1942, more probably than not, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened Communist that he either volunteered espionage information to the Soviets or complied with a request for such information. (This includes the possibility that when he singled out the weapons aspect of atomic development as his personal speciality, he was acting under Soviet instructions.) 2.

Nichols, general manager of the AEC. Pending resolution of the charges, Oppenheimer's security clearance was suspended. Oppenheimer told Strauss that some of what was in Nichols' letter was correct, some incorrect., [58], [59], Nichols wrote that he was, not happy with the inclusion of a reference concerning Oppenheimer's opposition to the hydrogen bomb development, . He considered that, in spite of his record he is loyal to the United States, ., [60], The hearing was chaired by, Gordon Gray, president of the, University of North Carolina, ., The hearing was held at a temporary building near the Washington Monument housing offices of the AEC, and began on April 12, 1954., [61], The AEC was represented by, Roger Robb, an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's legal team was headed by, Lloyd K.

At the commencement of the hearing, Gray stated the hearing was ""strictly confidential"", and pledged that no information related to the hearing would be released. Contrary to this assurance, a few weeks after the conclusion of the hearing a verbatim transcript of the hearing was released by the AEC. Oppenheimer and Garrison also breached the confidentiality of the hearing, by communicating with, The New York Times, journalist, James Reston, who wrote an article on the hearing that appeared on the second day of the hearing., [67], Garrison applied for an emergency security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted during the course of the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see.

On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's attorneys. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status., [68], The AEC's former general counsel Joseph Volpe had urged Oppenheimer to retain a tough litigator as his attorney; Garrison's demeanor was gentle and cordial, but Robb was adversarial. Garrison voluntarily provided the board and Robb with a list of his witnesses, but Robb refused to extend the same courtesy. This gave Robb a clear advantage in his cross-examination of Oppenheimer's witnesses., [69], One observer commented that Robb ""did not treat Oppenheimer as a witness in his own case, but as a person charged with high treason."", [70], Members of the hearing panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the contents of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946, Administrative Procedure Act, included a legal principle known as ""the exclusivity of the record"" or the "", blank pad rule, "".

This meant that a hearing could only consider information that had been formally presented under the established rules of evidence. However, while the act applied to the courts and to administrative hearings held by agencies like the, Federal Trade Commission, and, Federal Communications Commission, it did not apply to the AEC. Garrison asked for the opportunity to review the file with the panel, but this was rejected., [71], Scope of testimony, [, edit, ], As outlined in the 3, 500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser., [72], Nobel Prize–winning physicist, Enrico Fermi, was among the eminent scientists who testified in support of Oppenheimer., Oppenheimer testified for a total of 27 hours. His demeanor was very different from his previous interrogations, such as his appearance before HUAC.

Under cross-examination by Robb, who had access to top-secret information such as surveillance recordings, Oppenheimer was ""often anguished, sometimes surprisingly inarticulate, frequently apologetic about his past and even self-castigating."", [73], One of the key elements in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before, and he was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts that he had no chance to review. Under questioning by Robb, he admitted that he had lied to, Boris Pash, an Army counterintelligence officer, concerning the approach from Chevalier. Asked why he had fabricated a story that three people had been approached for espionage, Oppenheimer responded, ""Because I was an idiot."", [74], Much of the questioning of Oppenheimer concerned his role in the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and, Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party., [75], The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds of the review"

Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds of the review panel., [76], Groves, testifying as a witness for the AEC and against Oppenheimer, reaffirmed his decision to hire Oppenheimer. Groves said that Oppenheimer's refusal to report Chevalier was ""the typical American school boy attitude that there is something wicked about telling on a friend."" Under questioning from Robb, Groves said that under the security criteria in effect in 1954, he ""would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today""., [77], The official position of the Air Force was to support the suspension of the security clearance, which was given during testimony by its chief scientist, David T. Griggs, . Although his testimony was not pivotal in the decision, many physicists viewed Griggs as the ""Judas who had betrayed their god"", the brilliant theoretical physicist who led the successful wartime development of the atomic bomb., [78], Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Among them were Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hans Bethe, John J. McCloy, James B. Conant, and Bush, as well as two former AEC chairmen and three former commissioners., [79], Also testifying on behalf of Oppenheimer was Lansdale, who was involved in the Army's surveillance and investigation"

He testified that Oppenheimer was not a Communist, and that he was ""loyal and discreet""., [81], Ernest Lawrence was known to dislike political activities, seeing them as a waste of time better spent on scientific research. He did not oppose the investigations of Oppenheimer or others, tending to distance himself from those under investigation rather than supporting them., [82], He said he was unable to testify at the Oppenheimer hearing because of illness. On April 26, Lawrence suffered a severe colitis attack. The next day, Lawrence called Lewis Strauss and told him that his brother, a doctor, had ordered him to return home and that he would not be testifying., [83], Lawrence suffered with colitis until his death during colostomy surgery, on August 27, 1958., [84], [85], However, an interview transcript in which Lawrence stated that Oppenheimer ""should never again have anything to do with the forming of policy"" was presented at the hearing, and several other members of Lawrence's, Radiation Laboratory, did testify against Oppenheimer in person.

This resulted in later ill-feeling from the scientific community towards Lawrence and other members of his laboratory., [82], Edward Teller was opposed to the hearing, feeling it was improper to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that ""in a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more.""

Gray and Morgan voted in favor, Evans against. The board rendered its decision on May 27, 1954, in a 15, 000-word letter to Nichols. It found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially true. The board found that while he had been opposed to the H-bomb and that his lack of enthusiasm for it had affected the attitude of other scientists, he had not actively discouraged scientists from working on the H-bomb, as had been alleged in Nichols' letter. It found that ""there is no evidence that he was a member of the [Communist] party in the strict sense of the word, "" and concluded that he is a ""loyal citizen"". It said that he ""had a high degree of discretion, reflecting an unusual ability to keep to himself vital secrets, "" but that he had ""a tendency to be coerced, or at least influenced in"

It said that he ""had a high degree of discretion, reflecting an unusual ability to keep to himself vital secrets, "" but that he had ""a tendency to be coerced, or at least influenced in conduct, for a period of years."", [88], The board found that Oppenheimer's association with Chevalier ""is not the kind of thing that our security system permits on the part of one who customarily has access to information of the highest classification"", and concluded that ""Oppenheimer's continuing conduct reflects a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system, "" that he was susceptible ""to influence which could have serious implications for the security interests of the country, "" that his attitude toward the H-bomb program raised doubt about whether his future participation ""would be consistent with the best interests of security, "" and that Oppenheimer had been ""less than candid in several instances"" in his testimony. The majority therefore did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated., [89], In a brief dissent, Evans argued that Oppenheimer's security clearance should be reinstated. He pointed out that most of the AEC charges had been in the hands of the AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that ""to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security risk now"
"[89], In a brief dissent, Evans argued that Oppenheimer's security clearance should be reinstated. He pointed out that most of the AEC charges had been in the hands of the AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that ""to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security risk now than he was then, seems to be hardly the procedure to be adopted in a free country."" Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that ""our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country, "" and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development., [90], Protest by scientists at Los Alamos, [, edit, ], Starting on June 7, 1954, led by physicist Fred Ribe, 494 scientists at, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, signed a petition in protest of the security board's decision., [91], The petition was delivered to President Eisenhower, the members of the AEC, and the chair of the JCAE., [92], The petition acknowledged that it was up to the government to decide who they wanted as advisors, but said that ""it is inexcusable to employ the personnel security system as a means of dispensing with the services of a loyal but unwanted consultant."", [92], The petition then asserted that ""this poorly founded decision ... will make it"

Graves, Elizabeth Riddle Graves, David L. Hill, Nicholas Metropolis, Frederick Reines, and, Raemer Schreiber, ., [94], [95], Over 80 percent of the scientists in the theoretical division signed the petition, [94], as did about half of the scientists in the laboratory overall., [96], Fear of professional retribution reportedly kept some others from signing it., [96], Nichols letter and AEC ruling, [, edit, ], In a harshly worded memorandum to the AEC on June 12, 1954, Nichols recommended that Oppenheimer's security clearance not be reinstated. In five ""security findings"", Nichols said that Oppenheimer was ""a Communist in every sense except that he did not carry a party card, "" and that the Chevalier incident indicated that Oppenheimer ""is not reliable or trustworthy"", and that his misstatements might have represented criminal conduct. He said that Oppenheimer's ""obstruction and disregard for security"" showed ""a consistent disregard of a reasonable security system.""

The Nichols memorandum was not made public nor provided to Oppenheimer's lawyers, who were not allowed to appear before the AEC., [97], On June 29, 1954, the AEC upheld the findings of the Personnel Security Board, with four commissioners voting in favor and one, Henry DeWolf Smyth, opposed., [98], The decision was rendered 32 hours before Oppenheimer's consultant contract, and with it the need for a clearance, was due to expire., [99], In his majority opinion, Strauss said that Oppenheimer had displayed ""fundamental character defects"". He said that Oppenheimer ""in his associations had repeatedly exhibited a willful disregard of the normal and proper obligations of security, "" and that he ""has defaulted not once but many times upon the obligations that should and must be willingly borne by citizens in the national service."", [100], Despite the promise of confidentiality, the AEC released an edited transcript of the hearing in June 1954, after press publicity of the hearing., [101], The transcript was titled, In the Matter of J.

Although he was not fired from his job at the, Institute for Advanced Study, as he had feared he might be, he became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create., [105], He gave public lectures, [106], and spent several months of each year on the small island of, Saint John, in the, Caribbean, ., [107], Kai Bird, and, Martin J. Sherwin, considered the Oppenheimer case ""a defeat for American liberalism""., [108], Summing up the fallout from the case, they wrote that:, In a few years after World War II, scientists had been regarded as a new class of intellectuals, members of a public-policy priesthood who might legitimately offer expertise not only as scientists but as public philosophers. With Oppenheimer's defrocking, scientists knew that in the future they would serve the state only as experts only on narrow scientific issues. As sociologist, Daniel Bell, later observed, Oppenheimer's ordeal signified that the postwar ""messianic role of the scientists"" was now at an end.

"With Oppenheimer's defrocking, scientists knew that in the future they would serve the state only as experts only on narrow scientific issues. As sociologist, Daniel Bell, later observed, Oppenheimer's ordeal signified that the postwar ""messianic role of the scientists"" was now at an end. Scientists working within the system could not dissent from government policy, as Oppenheimer had done by writing his 1953, Foreign Affairs, essay, and still expect to serve on government advisory boards. The trial thus represented a watershed in the relations of the scientist to the government. The narrowest version of how American scientists should serve their country had triumphed., [109], Oppenheimer was seen by many in the scientific community as a, martyr, to, McCarthyism, a modern, Galileo, or, Socrates, [105], an intellectual and progressive unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific creativity from academia into the military., [110], Patrick McGrath noted that ""Scientists and administrators such as Edward Teller, Lewis Strauss and Ernest Lawrence, with their full-throated militarism and anti-communism pushed American scientists and their institutions toward a nearly complete and subservient devotion to American military interests."", [108], Scientists continued to work for the AEC, but they no longer trusted it., [111], Loyalty and security tests spread through the federal government.

"AEC, but they no longer trusted it., [111], Loyalty and security tests spread through the federal government. At these inquiries, federal employees were asked questions such as:, Is it proper to mix white and Negro blood plasma?, There is a suspicion in your record that you are in sympathy with the underprivileged. Is that true?, What were your feelings at that time concerning race equality?, Have you ever made statements about the ""downtrodden masses"" and ""underprivileged people""?, [112], Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb would never escape the public identification of them with the case., [105], In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman, asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President, John F. Kennedy, decided that the time had come to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963, Enrico Fermi Award, . The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was, assassinated later that day, . The award was presented by President, Lyndon B.

Its real purpose was larger, however: to punish the most prominent American critic of the U.S. move from atomic weapons to the much more lethal hydrogen bomb."" After the hearing, Lacayo said, ""Oppenheimer would never again feel comfortable as a public advocate for a sane nuclear policy."", [117], In a lengthy analysis of the security case published in the, Stanford Law Review, in 1990, Cold War historian, Barton J. Bernstein, posits that the remarkable thing about Oppenheimer was that he was ever able to hold a high-level security clearance in the first place, given his past associations and record of evasions, and that he had been given special treatment and protection by the U.S. government to allow him to work in the classified nuclear area for as long as"

Soviet intelligence tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and, Venona, documentation released after the fall of the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies with the Soviet Union., [122], AEC action nullified, [, edit, ], Over the years, the physicist Ribe, who had organized the 1954 petition, worked towards having the Oppenheimer charges undone, [123], as did other scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory., [124], Historians also pressed for revocation to be reversed, without success., [125], [126], Oppenheimer biographers, Kai Bird, and, Martin J.

I have not."", [139], Of his security hearing, he said: ""The whole damn thing was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it."", [140], In a response, Kipphardt offered to make corrections but defended the play, [141], which premiered on, Broadway, in June 1968, with, Joseph Wiseman, in the Oppenheimer role., New York Times, theater critic, Clive Barnes, called it an ""angry play and a partisan play"" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed the scientist as a ""tragic fool and genius""., [142], Oppenheimer was played by, Sam Waterston, in a, BBC miniseries, in 1980, which aired in the U.S. in 1982, that culminated in the security hearing., [143], Christopher Nolan, 's 2023 biopic, Oppenheimer, portrays both the security hearing and the Lewis Strauss confirmation hearing., [144], [145], Notes, [, edit, ], ^, a, b, Herken 2002, pp. 29–30., ^, a, b, Stern 1969, p. 12., ^, Bird & Sherwin 2005, pp. 54–61., ^, Herken 2002, p. 11., ^, Bird & Sherwin 2005, p. 82.,"

Robert Oppenheimer, is a 2005, biography, of theoretical physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the leader of the, Manhattan Project, which produced the first, nuclear weapons, written by, Kai Bird, and, Martin J. Sherwin, over a period of 25 years. It won numerous awards, including the 2006, Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, ., The book chronicles Oppenheimer's rise to fame as ""the father of the atomic bomb"" and director of the Manhattan Project, as well as his tragic downfall due to his, security hearing, in the, McCarthy era, . The book shows efforts by, Lewis Strauss, and the, FBI, to undermine Oppenheimer. The bomb is regarded as a crucial turning point and a significant meeting between science and wartime weapons. This pivots Oppenheimer as an important historical figure and a symbol for atomic bomb ethics and political discourse about nuclear power.

"important historical figure and a symbol for atomic bomb ethics and political discourse about nuclear power. The book delves into various components of Oppenheimer's life inside and outside the Manhattan Project. His early life, ambitions, ideas, political activities, marriage, relationships with other women and physicists, misgivings about the bomb, complexities, and shortcomings are also discussed in the book., The book served as inspiration for, Christopher Nolan, 's 2023, biographical film, Oppenheimer, starring, Cillian Murphy, as Oppenheimer., Summary, [, edit, ], The book includes five parts on different stages of Oppenheimer's life, as well as a prologue and epilogue., Prologue, [, edit, ], The prologue describes Oppenheimer's funeral and frames Oppenheimer's life as one of triumph and tragedy, a life of enigma, complexity, humanity, and love for his country. The prologue explains that the book is an attempt to elucidate Oppenheimer's life., Part 1, [, edit, ], Part one of the book begins tracing Oppenheimer's childhood and early education at the, Ethical Culture School, and, Harvard, describing Oppenheimer's precocious academic abilities, love for the nature of the, southwestern United States, and passion for physics. Oppenheimer commented on his childhood, ""My life as a child did not prepare me for the fact that the world is full of cruel and bitter things."", [2], The authors recount Oppenheimer's emotional crisis at the, University of Cambridge, his academic flourishment as a, theoretical physicist, at, Göttingen, and his role as the founder of the theoretical physics program at the, University of California, Berkeley, .

Versatile in many subjects, Oppenheimer formed his own cult of admirers, established an international reputation as a scientist, and developed an interest in the humanities and literature, including, Hindu scriptures, ., Part 2, [, edit, ], While a professor at Berkeley, Oppenheimer began an intense relationship with graduate student, Jean Tatlock, which instilled a new interest in social and political activism. Amidst the, Great Depression, Oppenheimer developed an appeal for the unemployed and migrant farmers and later gave donations for, Spanish relief, through the, Communist Party of America, (CPUSA) and funded, refugees, from, Nazi Germany, . At Berkeley, Oppenheimer held union meetings at his home and maintained an inner circle of students who became associated with left-wing activities. Oppenheimer's brother, Frank, joined the Communist Party to Robert's disapproval., Despite Oppenheimer's activism, the book points out that his exact relationship with the communist party remains unclear. Reports of friends and associates such as, Haakon Chevalier, and, FBI, recordings could merely portray him as a, fellow traveler, . Never formally having a card and later denying he ever had a membership, Oppenheimer described his interaction with the party as ""very brief and very intense."", [3], With new developments in fission research"
"that his exact relationship with the communist party remains unclear. Reports of friends and associates such as, Haakon Chevalier, and, FBI, recordings could merely portray him as a, fellow traveler, . Never formally having a card and later denying he ever had a membership, Oppenheimer described his interaction with the party as ""very brief and very intense."", [3], With new developments in fission research and the United States' entrance into the war, Oppenheimer shifted away from union organization and cut off communist friends, believing that otherwise, the government would not allow him to work on a fission bomb project. Oppenheimer was convinced that the acquisition of the bomb before the Nazis was essential, even if there were a remote possibility the bomb could ignite the atmosphere. In spite of having no army security clearance, he became a key intellectual leader in the top secret research "", Uranium Committee, ."", Leslie Groves was selected to lead the, Manhattan Project, to develop the first nuclear bomb. Impressed by Oppenheimer, Groves appointed Oppenheimer as director of the Radiation Lab despite significant opposition that Oppenheimer was too impractical., Part two ends by portraying what would be called the Chevalier Affair. Although many versions of the story exist, sources confirm that a friend asked Oppenheimer to provide confidential information for the Soviets, which Oppenheimer outright rejected. The affair would later become a crucial issue in Oppenheimer's security hearing., Part 3, [, edit, ], At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer became the scientific director of the Manhattan Project and transformed into a charismatic, effective,"
"called the Chevalier Affair. Although many versions of the story exist, sources confirm that a friend asked Oppenheimer to provide confidential information for the Soviets, which Oppenheimer outright rejected. The affair would later become a crucial issue in Oppenheimer's security hearing., Part 3, [, edit, ], At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer became the scientific director of the Manhattan Project and transformed into a charismatic, effective, organized administrator and patriotic leader. The book highlights how tight security, excess secrecy, and constant military surveillance burdened Oppenheimer and other scientists. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer met Jean Tatlock several times before discontinuing the relationship, after which she committed suicide., Despite suspicion and doubts by subordinates, Oppenheimer eventually acquired a security clearance but soon after told authorities about the Chevalier incident. While Groves believed Oppenheimer and Oppenheimer asserted there was no security threat, Oppenhiemer's decision to tell the story would become disastrous for his security hearing. Bird and Sherwin argue that Oppenheimer was committed to his trustworthiness as a scientist and the project's success rather than to an invariable loyalty to the United States., Niels Bohr, came to Los Alamos to discuss the implications of the bomb. He argued for openness to avoid a post-war nuclear arms race with Russia, a policy Oppenheimer would later promote. As one student noted, ""Bohr was God, and Oppie was his prophet."", [4], The scientists at Los Alamos continued discussions on the moral and political ramifications of the ""gadget"" or atomic bomb., After the defeat of the Nazis, colleagues of Oppenheimer began to doubt the purpose of the"
"openness to avoid a post-war nuclear arms race with Russia, a policy Oppenheimer would later promote. As one student noted, ""Bohr was God, and Oppie was his prophet."", [4], The scientists at Los Alamos continued discussions on the moral and political ramifications of the ""gadget"" or atomic bomb., After the defeat of the Nazis, colleagues of Oppenheimer began to doubt the purpose of the bomb and debated whether to use the bomb without warning or have a demonstration of the bomb for Japan. Oppenheimer supported the immediate use of the bomb, believing it might end all wars. Bird and Sherwin claim that Oppenheimer was unaware of any surrender talks by the Japanese., The book describes the influential presence of Oppenheimer in the physical production of the bomb. After some crisis about the bomb design, Oppenheimer pressed for the, plutonium implosion bomb, with lenses. Part three ends by detailing the, Trinity Test, of the first nuclear bomb., Part 4, [, edit, ], The book continues by exploring the events following the Trinity Test. Oppenheimer was aware of possible targets in Japan and would play a vital part in the efficiency of the atomic bombings of, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, . The authors recount Oppenheimer's serious qualms about the implications of the bombings and nuclear weapons. He later told, President Truman, ""I feel I have blood on my hands, "" a statement that would alienate the president from him., [5], Considered the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer became a celebrity, icon, and a scientist-statesman who was now influential"
"bombings of, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, . The authors recount Oppenheimer's serious qualms about the implications of the bombings and nuclear weapons. He later told, President Truman, ""I feel I have blood on my hands, "" a statement that would alienate the president from him., [5], Considered the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer became a celebrity, icon, and a scientist-statesman who was now influential in American politics. Oppenheimer hoped using the bombs would prevent a, nuclear arms race, with Russia. He urged for a transparent international regulation of atomic weapons and energy but soon supported a more conservative defensive stance to proliferate American nuclear weapons due to apparent ideological differences between Russia and the United States., As chairman of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission, Oppenheimer opposed the accelerated construction of the Super (, H-bomb, ). Despite the government's decision to move forward with the bomb, Oppenheimer continued his role as chairman but remained an outspoken critic of the bomb., Increased political influence led to greater surveillance by the FBI led by, J. Edgar Hoover, to investigate Oppenheimer's communist connections. Oppenheimer was asked to testify at a, HUAC, hearing and became an informant regarding former students' communist relations. In another meeting, Oppenheimer criticized communism and claimed he was ""a resolute anti-communist"" but continued to face suspicions and accusations of communist ties., [6], The book shows how Oppenheimer, amidst a stalemate of, Cold War, policy, became more estranged from politics in Washington, while still fatefully trying to remain an insider., Oppenheimer accepted an"

However, Oppenheimer would eventually humiliate Strauss in a congressional hearing, increasing animosity between the two. Seeking revenge, Strauss began investigating Oppenheimer with the help of the FBI and initiated a campaign to suppress Oppenheimer's political influence and smear his reputation. As chairman of the AEC, Strauss pushed forward with nuclear secrecy and proliferation. Eventually, President Eisenhower, attempted to cut off Oppenheimer from all government contacts and create a ""blank wall"" between the scientist and classified material., [7], The book also covers the stormy relationship between, Katherine, and Oppenheimer, in which Kitty appears extremely passionate and intense and Oppenheimer more disengaged. Kitty's desire for Oppenheimer to gain fame is also mentioned., Part 5, [, edit, ], The last part of the book deals primarily with Oppenheimer's, security hearing, and its aftermath. The authors argue that the proceedings constituted a, kangaroo court, orchestrated by Lewis Strauss, in which Oppenheimer was intentionally humiliated.

The authors argue that the proceedings constituted a, kangaroo court, orchestrated by Lewis Strauss, in which Oppenheimer was intentionally humiliated. The hearing board concluded that Oppenheimer was a security threat due to his past conduct and associations, stance on the hydrogen bomb, and less than candid responses. A following letter claimed that ""Dr. Oppenheimer was a Communist in every respect except for the fact that he did not carry a party card."", [8], Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked, and he became in the public eye a scientist-martyr and victim of, McCarthyism, . According to Bird and Sherwin, the hearing was a crucial turning point in the relations between scientists and the government and proved a defeat for American liberalism. Although an ""exiled intellectual, "" he would continue to lecture, write and give speeches., [9], Oppenheimer would eventually receive the, Enrico Fermi Award, but only over fifteen years after the Trinity Test., Epilogue, [, edit, ], The epilogue covers the lives of Oppenheimer's family and children after his death from, throat cancer, .

Peter, Oppenheimer's son, would settle in New Mexico and start a family, and Toni, Oppenheimer's daughter, would eventually commit suicide., Production, [, edit, ], Historian, Martin J. Sherwin, who had previously written, A World Destroyed: Hiroshima and Its Legacies, (1975), started to work on the Oppenheimer biography in 1979, [10], and signed the first contract with the publisher, Knopf, on March 13, 1980, for $70, 000., [11], Between 1979 and 1985, [10], he conducted interviews ""with 112 persons in his [Oppenheimer's] orbit"", [12], including his friend, Haakon Chevalier, and his son Peter, who refused a formal interview. Sherwin gathered ""some 50, 000 pages of interviews, transcripts, letters, diaries, declassified documents and F.B.I. dossiers, stored in seemingly endless boxes in his basement, attic and office"". After the deadline had come, and after his editor's retirement, Sherwin had still not finished the book., [11], Thomas Powers, writes that ""historians of the subject, a small gossiping group, suggested that Sherwin was the latest victim of the curse of Oppenheimer""., [10], The book became a joke in Sherwin's family, and he said ""that he was going to take the book to the grave""., [13], In 1999 Sherwin invited his friend, writer and editor, Kai Bird, [11], who had already written two political biographies, [10], to join him and put it together in a cohesive and readable format. At first Bird refused, but eventually agreed to work on the book,"

At first Bird refused, but eventually agreed to work on the book, and both authors signed a new contract with Knopf, for a further $290, 000. Bird wrote drafts that were then reviewed and rewritten by Sherwin., [11], The working title of the book was, Oppie, but that was vetoed by their editor. Susan Goldmark, Bird's wife, suggested the new title: "", Prometheus, … fire … the bomb is this fire. And you could put 'American' there."" Sherwin said that his friend, Ronald Steel, independently suggested the same title., [11], First comparison of the physicists who made the bomb possible to Prometheus was in the, Scientific Monthly, in September 1945: ""Modern Prometheans have raided Mount Olympus again and have brought back for man the very thunderbolts of Zeus."", [14], Some reviewers also connected the name of the book to, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, ., [15], Reception, [, edit, ], The biography was praised by critics., The Boston Globe, wrote that the book ""stands as an Everest among the mountains of books on the bomb project and Oppenheimer, and is an achievement not likely to be surpassed or equaled."", [11], Janet Maslin wrote in her, The New York Times, review that "", American Prometheus,"

It succeeds in deeply fathoming his most damaging, self-contradictory behavior."" She noted that it is ""a thorough examination and synthesis, sometimes overwhelming in its detail""., [16], Another reviewer notes that ""there is no mathematics and very little physics. There is little about the engineering of the “gadget” tested in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945."", [17], Thomas Powers, in his review of several Oppenheimer's biographies for, The New York Review, noted that Sherwin had an advantage in writing Oppenheimer's biography in 1979. Many friends and colleagues of Oppenheimer were, at that time, still alive., [10], Powers described the book as ""clear in its purpose, deeply felt, persuasively argued, disciplined in form, and written with a sustained literary power"", and notes the complex character of Oppenheimer:, [10], But it is Oppenheimer the man, not general ideas about the, nuclear age, that dominates these pages.

"and written with a sustained literary power"", and notes the complex character of Oppenheimer:, [10], But it is Oppenheimer the man, not general ideas about the, nuclear age, that dominates these pages. Oppenheimer emerges in all his complexity — a brainy theorist but also an ""underdogger"", quick in his sympathy for those at the bottom of the social ladder; a sometime revolutionary who irritated former students like Philip Morrison with his talk after the war about ""Dean"" and ""George""—, Dean Acheson, and, George Marshall, ; devoted defender of his alcoholic wife, Kitty, but blind to her ego-crushing treatment of their son, Peter; lifelong friend of students like, Serber, and betrayer of students like, Rossi Lomanitz, Joseph Weinberg, and, Bernard Peters, whom he simply threw to the Red-hunting wolves., Frank A. Settle called the book ""meticulously researched"" and ""the most comprehensive biography to date""., [18], Braham Dabscheck notes the ""scholarship of the highest order""., [12], John S. Rigden, calls the book ""well written and almost free of serious errors"", and that ""reading this worthy book is a gripping experience: It stimulates the mind and stirs the emotions."", [19], Thomas A. Julian critiqued the book and the authors, writing that ""[t]hey still assert, despite the conclusive evidence to the contrary ... that Japan was already defeated and wanted to 'surrender, ', "", and that they ""ignore disturbing evidence provided from former Soviet sources that Oppenheimer might have provided information to the Soviet Union about the U.S. atomic bomb project""., [20], Awards, [, edit, ], 2005, National Book Critics"

Nolan continued a newfound interest in Oppenheimer, reading, American Prometheus, and decided to base his screenplay on the book, centering on the, security clearance hearings, . Since 2015, the adaptation rights were owned by producer J. David Wargo, who agreed to work alongside Nolan., [13], Nolan met with Bird as Sherwin had been diagnosed with cancer and was not able to travel., [13], [1], Bird read the script prior to filming:, [24], ""Nolan covers in a very deft way the argument among the physicists over whether the bomb was necessary or not and has Oppenheimer after Hiroshima saying the bomb was used on a virtually already defeated enemy, "" Bird adds.

Robert Oppenheimer—the substance of his life, his intellect, his patrician manner, his leadership of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, his political affiliations and postwar military/security entanglements, and his early death from cancer, amount to a highly compelling story., Born Julius Robert Oppenheimer on April 22, 1904, in New York City, Oppenheimer grew up in a Manhattan apartment adorned with paintings by van Gogh, Cézanne, and Gauguin. His father, Julius Oppenheimer, was a German immigrant who worked in his family's textile importing business. His mother, Ella Friedman, was a painter whose family had been in New York for generations. His younger brother, Frank, would also become a physicist., In 1921, Oppenheimer graduated from the Ethical Culture School of New York at the top of his class. At Harvard, Oppenheimer studied mathematics and science, philosophy and Eastern religion, and French and English literature. He was admitted to graduate standing in physics in his first year as an undergraduate on the basis of independent study.

"was admitted to graduate standing in physics in his first year as an undergraduate on the basis of independent study. During a course on thermodynamics taught by Percy Bridgman, Higgins University Professor of Physics at Harvard, Oppenheimer was introduced to experimental physics, which quickly caught his attention. He graduated summa cum laude in 1925 and afterwards went to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory as research assistant to J. J. Thomson. Uninspired by routine laboratory work, he went to the University of Göttingen, in Germany, to study quantum physics. Oppenheimer met and studied with some of the day's most prominent figures, including Max Born and Niels Bohr. In 1927, Oppenheimer received his doctorate, and in the same year, he worked with Born on the structure of molecules, producing the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation. Subsequently, he traveled from one prominent center of physics to another: Harvard, California Institute of Technology, Leyden, and Zürich. In 1929, he received offers to teach at Caltech and the University of California at Berkeley. Accepting both, he divided his time between Pasadena and Berkeley, attracting his own circle of brilliant young physics students., Oppenheimer in 1947 at the Shelter Island conference where theoretical physicists gathered to discuss the state of their field in the aftermath of World War II.

Feynman (seated, with pen in hand), and Herman Feshbach, “His lectures were a great experience, for experimental as well as theoretical physicists, ” commented the late physicist Hans Bethe (1906–2005), who would later work with Oppenheimer at Los Alamos. “In addition to a superb literary style, he brought to them a degree of sophistication in physics previously unknown in the United States. Here was a man who obviously understood all the deep secrets of quantum mechanics, and yet made it clear that the most important questions were unanswered. His earnestness and deep involvement gave his research students the same sense of challenge. He never gave his students the easy and superficial answers but trained them to appreciate and work on the deep problems.”, When Julius Oppenheimer died in 1937, Oppenheimer became a wealthy man. In 1940, he married Katherine (Kitty) Puening Harrison, a biologist and divorcee whose second husband had been killed during the Spanish Civil War. The couple had two children, Peter and Katherine., World War II interrupted the work and lives of most American physicists.

"married Katherine (Kitty) Puening Harrison, a biologist and divorcee whose second husband had been killed during the Spanish Civil War. The couple had two children, Peter and Katherine., World War II interrupted the work and lives of most American physicists. In 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed to the Manhattan Project, code name for the project formed to develop an atomic bomb., The project involved several laboratories in secret locations across the country, including the University of Chicago; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Oppenheimer oversaw the construction of the Los Alamos laboratory, where he gathered the best minds in physics to work on the problem of creating an atomic bomb. Because of his leadership in this project, he is often referred to as the “father” of the atomic bomb., Alan Richards, Robert Oppenheimer (right) with John von Neumann in front of the Electronic Computer Project’s ENIAC machine, ca. 1952., When the war ended, the government set up the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to replace the Manhattan Project. The AEC was charged with overseeing all atomic research and development in the United States. As Chairman of the General Advisory Committee, Oppenheimer opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. Known as the “Super Bomb, ” the hydrogen bomb was a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb. In the context of the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power, Oppenheimer's stance was controversial. In the 1950s, while Oppenheimer was Director of the Institute, anti-Communist hysteria was sweeping through Washington, D.C.,"
"the development of the hydrogen bomb. Known as the “Super Bomb, ” the hydrogen bomb was a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb. In the context of the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power, Oppenheimer's stance was controversial. In the 1950s, while Oppenheimer was Director of the Institute, anti-Communist hysteria was sweeping through Washington, D.C., spearheaded by the conservative Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. McCarthy and anti-Communist zealots devoted themselves to rooting out Communist spies from every walk of American life. Oppenheimer was subjected to a security investigation that became a cause célèbre and divided the intellectual and scientific community. In 1953, he was denied security clearance and lost his position with the AEC. Doors that had formerly been open to him were closed. “Oppenheimer took the outcome of the security hearing very quietly but he was a changed person; much of his previous spirit and liveliness had left him, ” recalled Bethe., Oppenheimer’s concern for the general public’s lack of scientific understanding, and the difficulty of conveying the content of scientific discoveries as well as the exhilaration of the creative act of discovery to even educated lay people, led to several popular essays on science. He delivered the Reith Lectures on the BBC in 1953, and these were published under the title “Science and the Common Understanding.”, In April 1962, the U.S. Government made amends for the treatment Oppenheimer suffered during the McCarthy years, when President Kennedy invited him to a White House dinner of Nobel"

In 1963, President Johnson awarded Oppenheimer the highest honor given by the AEC, the Fermi Award., Oppenheimer died of throat cancer on February 18, 1967., A number of plays have been written about Oppenheimer, and American composer John Adams (, Nixon in China, ) composed an opera commissioned by the San Francisco Opera entitled, Doctor Atomic, which premiered in September 2005. There are also a large number of books on Oppenheimer and his life, including most recently, J.

What you say is true: I do value it—and I think that you do too—more than for its earthly fruit, proficiency. I think that one can give only a metaphysical ground for this evaluation; but the variety of metaphysics which gave an answer to your question has been very great, the metaphysics themselves very disparate: the bhagavad gita, Ecclesiastes, the Stoa, the beginning of the Laws, Hugo of St Victor, St Thomas, John of the Cross, Spinoza. This very great disparity suggests that the fact that discipline is good for the soul is more fundamental than any of the grounds given for its goodness. I believe that through discipline, though not through discipline alone, we can achieve serenity, and a certain small but precious measure of freedom from the accidents of incarnation, and charity, and that detachment which preserves the world which it renounces.

"for its goodness. I believe that through discipline, though not through discipline alone, we can achieve serenity, and a certain small but precious measure of freedom from the accidents of incarnation, and charity, and that detachment which preserves the world which it renounces. I believe that through discipline we can learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances, and to abandon with simplicity what would else have seemed to us indispensable; that we come a little to see the world without the gross distortion of personal desire, and in seeing it so, accept more easily our earthly privation and its earthly horror—But because I believe that the reward of discipline is greater than its immediate objective, I would not have you think that discipline without objective is possible: in its nature discipline involves the subjection of the soul to some perhaps minor end; and that end must be real, if the discipline is not to be factitious. Therefore I think that all things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war, and personal hardship, and even the need for subsistence, ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude, for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace.”, ―, J.

Feld suspects that the Ratio of Pjy'2 to P3/2 ^ ontributions=:b/c scattering is a better way to determine experimentally which ratio in fact holds The effect of electric dipole production of charged mesons has already been dis cussed. The second point Feld made had to do with the resonance in the neutral photo- meson production so strongly indicated by the Cal 0 Tech, data. If there is a true resonance,, it will in fact make itself felt even at the threshold, that is, in distort­ ing the dependence of the meson matrix element* Thus even if the resonance- were of zero width and occured with a peak at 300 Mev, the resonance factor^^j^^p would contribute at threshold,, The effect of this term is indicated on page in comparison with Goldschmidt-Clermont 1 s excitation curve. The data is not yet good enough to say whether or not the resonance manifests itself near threshold, but it is conceivable that a considerable improvement in experimental accuracy could settle this point. Finally, the resonance may not be as strong as one would think, at first sight.

Further, the interference effects have not been calculated 0 Hence, part of the reduction in the cross section beyond the maximum could be due to the reduced contribution at 90° due to the increasing importance of the electric quadrupole term. This might per­ haps explain a factor 2 but not the observed.decrease of a factor 4, Marshak injected one word of warning about the photoproduction resonance.

This can be seen by considering the following diagram: The slow nucléon has angular slow nucléon J = l/2; Parity = + (definition) r.ucleon j -1/2; mesonj P ~ 1 momentum 1/2 and we arbitrar­ ily define its intrinsic parity P as positive 0 Then the emitted nucléon continues to have j —1/2 and positive parity* and we can ask what must be the angular momentum and parity of the emitted meson 0 Clearly it can only have angular momentum equal to either 0 or 1, and since its intrinsic par­ ity is negative with respect to the proton, the parity of the angular momentum state must be negative 0 Therefore"

It is clear that in order to absorb an s state meson, nucléon pairs must be employed as indicated in the second diagram* This is c"" ?ar since the parity of the initial state is odd and the intrin­ sic parity of a nucléon pair is odd for Dirac particles; therefore, the same argument applies.

The above formulae are based on one of Schwinger ls variational principles. They are valid so long as the non-relativis- tic cut-off approach is valid, and even if the cut-off approximation fails they will indicate correctly the direction and order of magnitude of the reaction effects.

The discussion of these points will be left to Dyson 0 Chew ss own feeling is that only the p wave calculation is believable since it does not involve the relativis­ tic properties of the nucléon, Dyson then described the investigation of the pion-nucléon scattering pro­ blem by the theoretical group at Cornell, which was started as a direct conse­ quence of hearing what Chew had done* The people working on this are Bethe, Dyson, Salpeter, Ross, Sundaresan, Schweber, Mitra, and Visscher* We attempt to carry out the calculation of the meson-nucleon interaction using the full blooded relativistic theory, and in particular take seriously the relativis­ tic properties of the nucléons.

The method adopted is due to Tamm and Dan- coff and will be explained briefly here* If we use the relativistic meson theory58 we find that a complete description of the meson-nucleon system cannot be expressed in terms of a single particle or a two particle wave function; one needs a wave func­ tion which represents a mixture of states with all kinds of numbers of particles pre­ sent,, That is 5 Here the first subscript re *rs to the number of nucléons present and the second to the number of mesons present, so that the first line corresponds to a single nucléon with 1, 2, 0 mesoiiSj etc, present while the second line corresponds to three nuclé­ ons present with 1, 2 or 0 mesons, etc 0 The fundamental equation of the theory is the simple Schroedinger eqm: ion H^- where H- Hjj+Hj and H Q corresponds to the non-interacting particle Hamiltonian, that is, H^ corresponds to the energy of interaction» When this equation is expressed in terms of the components of the wave function, it becomes a complicated infinite array of coupled in;*gral equations, and there is J chance of obtaining an exact solution 0 The basic idea is to restrict all considerations to a certain"

When this is done we find, for example, an equation for the one meson part of the wave function^ y(k) defined by the equation (H - E k - E)^ Jdk' H x (k,k<) y- 2(k,k').

How­ ever, we stopped here as it was not clear how to go any further c The main com­ plication in the pion scattering problem is that the relativistic behavior of the nu~ cleons is taken seriously, In Levy 3 s analysis of the neutron-proton system, he could make a consistent non~relativistic approximation, that is, he assumed that the nucléon wave function only contained low momenta and his final result confirmed this assumption* This is by no means the case for pion-nucleon scattering,. We were able to write down an integral equation for the ^ part of the wave function alone, which restates the Schroedinger equation in our approximation. We were able to derive individual equations for each scattering state much as Chew has done. The phase shifts have been computed from these equations by means of a variational principle used by Chew, They confirm Chew gs results very well. The relativistic properties do give cut-off at momenta comparable to the nucléon rest mass 0 Therefore we find the same qualitative behavior as Chew for^ , namely a strong attractive potential close to resonance which is sensitive to^the strength of the interaction.

The other phase shifts are insensitive functions of the59 energy. We have also tried to solve the isotopic spin 3/2 integral equations numer­ ically in order to get a check on the general behavior of the space wave function and to estimate the accuracy of the variational principles used 0 It turns out that the estimates made by the Chew method for the ^33 phase shift are very bad 0 For example, for —10 at 110 Mev, the Born approximation result (2x) is approximately 5° 0 The estimate by Chew l's method gives a denominator of approximately 1/5 and hence a phase shift of about 25 „ But the exact solution yields 9°« The reason is simply that the wave function is far from correctly given by the Born approximation. The reactive terms are greatly overestima­ ted by such a variational principle. Therefore, it is difficult to get solutions for the 0(33 phase shift, which are accurate enough to be useful, even if we ig­ nore the inaccuracy of the starting equations,, Actually, Bethe has performed a rather complete calculation which will be discussed in the theoretical session tomorrow* However^ the results will be reported here to the full groups He used a coupling constant G^ 23014 and obtained phase shifts approximately as"

The results are, however, not in good agreement with the experiment As Chew has said, the s phase shift is proportional to the momen­ tum and the order of magnitude is correctly given as 15 to 20° at 135 Mev 0 But the energy dependence is quite wrong. Furthermore, isotopic spin 1/2 phase shift is not calculated consistently 0 Experimentally it should be small; theore­ tically we don't know what it is* But the theory is unambiguous for the isotopic spin 3/2 s phase and gives a variation linear with the momentum,. Therefore, if the phase shift is large enough at 135 Mev, it is much too large at 80 Mev and this is not by any means a consequence of our way of doing things. The point is, it does not matter to what order of perturbation theory you go, it does not matter how you set up your equations, as long as the meson must come in and interact with the proton, then the interaction has a range which is of the order of the pro­ ton Compton wave length, and a repulsive interaction of this range cannot give you phase shifts which are essentially different from hard sphere"

This would possibly explain the rapid energy variation of the s phase shift but this calcu­ lation has not been made exact as yet.

No one has any notion, for instance, of how one could in this way understand the masses of proton and neutron, or the magnetic mo­ ments of proton and neutron, or the difference between them, or the electrical pro­ perties of neutron^ and no one understands how one will in detail get the small deviations from charge symmetry, but there have been big changes in the last few years. These are, that instead of on the one hand using manifestly inadequate mathematical tools to find out what this theory predicts, and on the other hand wav­ ing generally in the direction of the unknown, one has now found some way of getting a little closer to what the theory predicts 0 I think no one is sure that one can even read the theory with arbitrary accuracy; that is, that something better than a iugh solution which cannot be impro d upon exists 0 This is an open question and I have no wisdom to add to it 0 But the point now is that one can recognize in the conse­ quences of the theory some things which bear a remote resemblance to what is found in real life.

"(Tuesday Afternoon: Theoretical Session , J. Schwinger presiding.) Klein presented the first paper in the session on the results which have been obtained by the past year from studying the renormalizable field theories in the low energy limit, that is the theorems on gamma ray scattering, photo meson production, and meson nucléon scattering. These investigations have served to clarify the meaning of the coupling constant in the meson theory, and those experiments which can be expected to determine this coupling constant. The techniques which have been used to date can also be extended to the problem of nuclear forces and other phenomena. Klein first presented a tabular summary of the theorems which have been proved, and then presented a typical demonstra­ tion of one of the theorems. These theorems all concern the scattering matrix 2 T(k), where k represents an external bosoavmomentum; T is proportional to the cross section. All the theorems are of the general structure that -7t- where ^ is the scattering matrix, is the Born approximation result, and the mass which occurs is a renormalized mass characteristic of the system. The theorems state that as the momentum of the external boson k goes to zero and the mass of the external boson goes to zero that the scattering matrix is given by this Born approximation result. Thus to carry out a measurement of the coupling constant, one looks for a process which is first order in the electromagnetic or meson field, that is an experiment which is quadratic in the coupling con­ stant."

Thus to carry out a measurement of the coupling constant, one looks for a process which is first order in the electromagnetic or meson field, that is an experiment which is quadratic in the coupling con­ stant. The theorems which have been proved and their authors are listed in Table 1.-79- The gamma ^arnma process is gamma ray scattering or meson scattering from a particle of spin l/2j Low remarked that the theorems.can easily be extended to particles with other spin. Klein then presented a paraphrase of a unified demonstration of all these theorems given by Schwinger, using as an example the gamma ray theorem. One has for the scattering matrix in this case the expression in this expression the é-^function is four dimensional, p and k refer to the proton momentum and photon momentum respectively, G is the Green 1s function in « the absence of the external field. Hence G^ operating on the free particle spinnor u(p) gives zero unless there is some part of the second variational derivative which has a second order pole on the free particle energy shell.

That is, the proof tfepends on the simple structure of G in the low energy limit. T 0 continue with the derivation of the Thomsontheorem, m consider the free particle Green's function in the absence of the external field which is The statement that there is a stable state of motion of the system with mass m implies that the additional contribution JG is analytic in the neighborhood of Yp +ni- 0. In order to obtain the gamma ray scattering to zero order in the frequency, we need only know the dependence of G on a uniform electro­ magnetic potential. This can be obtained simply by allowing p to be replaced by p~e A. In this case the variational derivative can be replaced by an ordinary derivative and since G is still an analytic -function of p-e A, it can give no contribution at Kp--m except from the first term. In extending the theorem to first order in the frequency, it is more con- venient to work with the second order Green's function 2m/(p 4~ m )•• Then the theorem states that to first order in the frequency it is sufficient to take One can easily see that there would be a contribution to the scattering if"

Hence if we have defined, the magnetic moment term appearing in the denominator cor­ rectly, it is impossible for such a term to appear. Ûf course one also needs that statement that.to first order in the frequency, G can only depend on crF and Ypj\this is riot immediately obvious but can be proved by invoking relativ- istic invariance, gage invariance, and charged invariance.» In our expansion of G about G^ , we can fall back on the statement that the next term must be an analytic function of G^ alone because of our definition of• Hence thefirst term which can occur is ^Ad* F, G^jh which is second order in the frequency., There cannot be a term in AF 0 It is possible to have a term in but again in order not to give a contribution to the magnetic moment 2 2 we can show that the leading term must be G (<T F) , arid when one take? a variational derivative"

The essential content of all this is that simply by virtue of our defin­ ition of charge, mass, and magnetic moment, we have so determined the structure of G in the neighborhood of the singularity that there can be no further con­ tributions to it. The proof of the p wave theorem for meson scattering is entirely analogous. If one looks explicitly at the structure of the Green* s function, one finds that if it is second order in the meson wave function it cannot give p wave scattering, so that the analog to the gamma ray s wave theorem is the meson p wave theorem. One can further show that the Kroll-Rudermann theorem on photomeson production is the consequence of the p wave meson theorem and gauge invariance.

They had first intended to report on the Kroll-Rudermann theorem for p wave scattering, which has already been mentioned by Klein above. They believe this can be used to determine the coupling constant from the p wave meson nucléon scattering. The theorem states simply that They can prove that the correction term is finite as'w goes to zero, and that 2 the coefficient f is the Kroll-ftudermann renormalized coupling constant.. The theorem can be stated for all four p states and, including the correction term is of the formIn the 33 ca^e it can be proved in the static theory that the coefficient of the correction term is negative. This can also be proved in the relativistic theory, if one neglects pairs and external nucléon recoil. By external nucléon recoil is meant the following. Consider the following diagram. Wo matter what occurs in the center of the diagram or how high the momenta, if one can simply drop the term -*q, which corresponds to the momentum of the nucléon both at the beginning and the end of the diagram, then the sign of the correction term must be negative. Hence if one can somehow find pair damping in the pseudo- scalar meson theory, one can hope to obtain agreement between the theory and experiment.

Hence if one can somehow find pair damping in the pseudo- scalar meson theory, one can hope to obtain agreement between the theory and experiment. The coefficients of the correction term in the four states as given above are a consequence of the crossing theorem of Gell-Mann and Goldberger as applied to the p wave. By explicit calculation using the cutoff theory, the correction term coefficient x is found to be fairly small. It is presumably small in the relativistic theory also at least at low energy. Hence if the 33 state is enhanced, the 11 state is depressed, and if it is not justifiable to use Born approximation on the 33 state, it is also not justifiable to use iton the 11 state. The above expression is therefore the form which the Kroll- Rudermann theorem and the Gell-Mann Goldberger crossing theorem take for meson nucléon scattering. So far at least the Kroll~&udermann theorem for the photo effect does not appear to be as useful, since so far no way has been found to extrapolate it to zero. However it is possible using the cutoff theory to calculate the photo- production explicitly and obtain an expression which, outside of dependence on masses, coupling constant, and magnetic moments, involves only the sine of the measured pion nucléon scattering phase shift.

This expression is in re­ markable agreement with experiment in the low energy region. Low then turned to a great calculational advance which has been made in that an easily soluble equation has been found for the pion nucléon scattering. The equations do not produce divergences on interactions so long as pairs are neglected, so that the 11 equation is just as easy to solve as the 33 equation. Unfortunately the equations are non-linear so that at present it is not known whether they possess solutions in generalj however in all the special cases that have been tried so far, exact solutions can be found. For simplicity this equation will be derived using the static theory. In what follows the wave functions which are used are exact wave functions of the entire Hamiltonian. For example an exact incoming wave eigenstate with where f Q is the unrenormalized coupling constant and v(k) is the momentum cutoff n mesons and a physical nucléon present will be symbolized by and the matrix element of the interaction we are interested in will be Here - Y3 —function of the theory.

The claim is that the S matrix for the scattering is given by In order to derive the equation, Low had permission from Wick to use a trick of his which goes as follows, We write where &?L is the creation operator for the scattering state, substituting this f expression into the Schroedinger equation one obtains directly that Note, that although recoil can be included with no trouble, it is impossible to use this trick at present if there are pairs present, since no one knows how to write down correctly the asymptotic eigenstate in this case. Now having obtained an explicit solution, we substitute this into the matrix element giving Since is a function only of <T ; t} J&>> it commutes with a^« However, since Cj? 0 *s a physical nucléon, eigenstate, does not vanish because there are virtual mesons present in the meson cloud surrounding the nucieon.

In order to evaluate the energy denominators one introduces the projection operators for the scattering eigenstates, that is the eigenstates of the complete Hamiltonian, by writing In this one meson approximation, the equation for the phase shift can be obtained immediately and is The term in this equation which couples the phase shifts of different momentum and isotopic spin is the term which enables this equation to satisfy the Gell- Mann-Qoldberger crossing theorem. That is, thanks to this term if you inter­ change q and k and the isotopic spin /£ and ^ and change the sign of Uf 9 the equation is reproduced. Note that in the static theory the 13 and 31 Note that when we have the terms corresponding to 1 meson scattering states this gives us immediately an integral equation for the matrix element.

Note in par­ ticular that the k dependence of the matrix element and of the equation is trivial, which leads to a tremendous simplification for the static theory. If in particular we restrict ourselves to the approximation of keeping only those intermediate states in which there is one meson present asymptotically, one obtains an equation for the q state itself involving only the q state. (That is, if one solves this equation once, one has immediately solved for the momentum dependence of the phase shifts over the entire range where the equa­ tion is applicable.)TE"" scattering states are identical so that there are only 3 phase shifts. The relativistic theory without recoil has the same property since in Born approx­ imation one has this property and the Gell4fenn-Goldberger theorem insures it for the correction term. The.matrix coupling the different phase shifts is and the coefficient is given by Born approximation, that is Note that the Gel1-Mann-Goldberger crossing theorem states that must be an eigenvector of IL^ with eigenvalue -JLj that is, for even powers of £4/the eigenvalue is -M and for odd powers ~l f If one now substitutes into this equation the state in which no mesons are present one obtains simply ^4 but according to all the standard methods of renormalization we have Hence the equation we have written down above contains the renormalized coupling constant.

If the coupling term & is dropped the equation can be solved exactly, with one numerical integral. This numerical integral turns out to be the original one Chew wrote down to give the phase shifts, which was presented at this conference a couple of years ago, That is Chew* s original equation in the zero order approximation In the iteration solution of this equation.The equation which can be solved exactly has the form Its solution is simply The approach to solving the equations with the coupling term A present is to make a reasonable guess at the effect of the coupling and put this into the Born approximation for the non-linear equation; then an equivalent equation can be found which can be solved. It is possible to do the integrals, so that relatively complicated guesses can be done quite easily and the consistency of these checked. This in fact is how the one meson approximation results given in the pion session by Chew were obtained. It is also possible to find a simple equation for the photo meson produc­ tion problem and to solve it in a very good approximation. The matrix element which is calculated is and is given in"
"done quite easily and the consistency of these checked. This in fact is how the one meson approximation results given in the pion session by Chew were obtained. It is also possible to find a simple equation for the photo meson produc­ tion problem and to solve it in a very good approximation. The matrix element which is calculated is and is given in this approximation by the expression The two terms in the curly braces are the Born approximation: the first of these is the Kroll-Rudermann term and the second is the term which comes from the p wave low energy iimit theorem. The only important correction to this result is given in the third term and arises from the 33 state. Low believes that this result is, in fact, much more general than the one meson approximation. Two meson corrections were estimated for the scattering in the forward directionin Born approximation, and are about 15$, but so far these corrections have not been estimated for the photoproduction problem. The anomolous magnetic moments of neutron and proton appear in the formula because the calculation was done using the relativistic theory and the entire current between the two nucléon states; the terms which gave rise to this coefficient then could be identified as the static moment of the nucléon to order (v/c) • Low does not believe this is the same as introducing a Pauli moment into the calculation since that would give transitions to negative energy states, which have not been allowed for here.

To summarize what has been proved by Low and Chew: first it has been shown that if the function of the phase shifts given above is extrapolated to zero for 2 all four p states, this should give the same f ; second if one can neglect pairs in the relativistic theory then the slope of the extrapolated straight line has the correct sign to give the resonant solution for the 33 state; third it has been proved that a third parameter is needed to give the phase shifts in this linear approximation for the other three p states. Finally this calculation makes it much clearer why the cutoff theory is in such good agreement with the experiment, since the two free parameters of the theory can be used to give tte correct intercept and slope for the effective range function of the 33 state.

They are interested primarily in doing a cal­ culation of multiple meson production in the Bloch-Nordsiek approximation but in order to get parameters for this calculation, they have calculated the Tomonaga approximation to meson scattering with a finite source. The radial dependence of the wave function is factored out, and its Fourier transform isHere M is the normalisation constant chosen so that / £f- / > u(k) ia a square cutoff function, and the parameter ^ is detenrdned by a varia­ tional equation. In order to fit the 33 scattering, the cutoff had to be chosen as 6.2^/, the unrenormaliaed coupling constant vas 0-712, the ratio Z2/Z^ — 0.3S4, and hence the renormalized coupling constant is 0.105. It is interesting to recall that in the extreme strong coupling limit ^\ * s ^* * n ^ac^> strong coupling is a good approximation to this part of the problem. This is similar to other results, such as for example Watson found in scattering, that the strong and the weak coupling approximation give the same result except for a numerical factor* Also the location of the peaks of the wave functions agrees with the strong coupling result; however, the wave functions are wider and have longer tails.

On the other hand, since for the weak or strong coupling limit the parameter )\ is zero, this result is rather far from either limit in that sense. In order to calculate the anomalous magnetic moments, the electromagnetic field is introduced in a gauge invariant way. The particular method chosen is such ttet only the term (jrjne60n^) contributes to the calculation of the anomalous moments. The result is3L If this calculation were done the way Pauli and Dancoff did it, you would add .16 to this result. The strong coupling limit would give the anomalous moment of the proton as 2.76; the dif­ ference here is primarily due to the fact that the parameter X is 3.39 instead of zero. The average number of mesons in the field is of the order of two, but because of the- tail on the wave functions the probability amplitudes for more mesons in the field are important.The results for the p phase shifts as the function of energy are gi\m in Table 2* If one makes a plot of £^33 using these values and the Chew-Low function, this does not give a straight line and does not"

If one neglects nucléon recoil and so on as is being done here, then you are calculating the properties of the following operator where The Tomonaga approximation consists of replacing this function by an exponential. However, if you actually plot the logarithm of this function, you find that it is made up of the sum of two exponentials, one of which has a very rapid variation determined essentially by the cutoff mass, and superimposed on this a very slowly varying weak tail.

If one were to calculate in the center of mass system and ignore pairs, presumably one should obtain Miller's matrix element. However if one tries to do this it is not so immediate. One has the equation This would be easy to solve were it not for the fact that the Miller matrix calculating the wave function in momentum space and transforming to coordinate Hence when k-rko there are quaaratically divergent termsj so if one tries to solve by an iteration procedure, one would never obtain the phase shifts characteristic of the old-fashioned Gordon-Mott solution in the non-relativistic limit.

One could presumably introduce an artificial coordinate intermediate variable and solve the problem in much the same way as. was done by Mott and Gordon in the non-relativistic case. However it is simpler to use a connection between the energy and the phase shifts. If one has a quantizing sphere, then the number of wave lengths of the wave functions inside this sphere will be very large compared to the radius of the sphere. If one introduces a small shift in the energy, then in order to keep the same number of nodes in the wave functions and hence the same quantum numbers one gets a connection between the element M contains factors like l/(pi - Pi«) • Using Dirac fs method for 7 ' Expanding this onephase shifts and the energy.

If the phase depends on space time it is easy to show and in order to preserve invariance, one needs to introduce a vector field with zero charge and zero mass. In this case there is no complication such as the non-linear terms which arose in the case of iso- topic spin. The consequence of this vector field is a heavy particle number associated with any system and.a repulsive force between any two objects. If the number of nucléons in the two objects are A^ and Ag this force plus the gravita­ tional force will then be Since M and A are not strictly proportional, the observational consequence of this would be in apparent difference between gravitational and inertial mass for differ­ ent objects. This vas studied experimentally quite extensively by Eotvos up to about 1920 and he found that the ratio between gravitational and inertial mass is constant for all objects with an accuracy of 1 part in 10 * Since the packing fraction in nuclei varies by a factor of 1000, this means that the repulsive force postulated here can be at most only 10~ 5 of the gravitational force.

TM« Yang raised the question of whether it is true that every conservation law1~r accuracy could be sharpened by comparing objects with a very large difference in packing fraction directly, such as hydrogen and oxygen. The negative exper- imcntal results seem to indicate either that the idea that every conservation law is associated with a gauge transformation is groundless, or that one needs to look for another type of group to generate the constitution of heavy particles. In reply to a question of Feynman fs, Yang noted that the coupling constant associated with this force cannot go to zero since then the phase, which is proportional to the coupling constant, vanishes and one cannot preserve the invariance. In response to a question of Breit's as to whether this violates the principle of equivalence, Oppenheimer noted that there is no difficulty here since the transformation law obeyed by this field is different from that of the gravitational field. He noted however that there might be a much more sensi­ tive test, in that with a vector field velocity dependent effects could be quite large in nuclei, and these might contribute terms which would go the other way from the static term given here.

Foldy raised the point that since the sun is largely composed of hydrogen, one might also, be able to find a sensitive test in astronomical effects. Fierz had some remarks to make on the dangers of using certain models to give a clue as to the behavior of quantum electrodynamics. For example Thirring has shown that part of the propagation function of the theory whose Hamiltonian is cannot be expanded in powers of the so-called coupling constant. However one can see very immediately that such a theory cannot be developed at all in powers of the coupling constant. In such a theory the classical limit is contained, so one can simply look at the classical theory. The energy of such a field is not positive definite, so it is always possible to make the system unstable* One can write down the solutions of the classical theory and show in fact .that they7 * can never be developed in powers of the coupling constant. If one used instead a #tyh coupling term, then the energy is positive definite but G-0 is an essential singularity of the theory, since if the sign of G is reversed one again"
"make the system unstable* One can write down the solutions of the classical theory and show in fact .that they7 * can never be developed in powers of the coupling constant. If one used instead a #tyh coupling term, then the energy is positive definite but G-0 is an essential singularity of the theory, since if the sign of G is reversed one again gets instability. However one can ft conclude anything about quantum electrodynamics from such a model. In the Pauli-Weicskopf theory the energy essentially must be positive definite no matter what you assume about the value of the charge. Because of gauge and energy conservation the fields are always limited. However in Dirac theory there is no classical limit and such arguments cannot be used. So Fierz wanted to warn that it is probably a bad idea to try to draw any conclusions about quantum electrodynamics from such models « Feynman talked about possible ways you might start to calculate the specific relativistic theory with the Interaction given by ^ (p ^5 ^ There is lots of evidence that this theory is wrong and Feynman doesn st believe it, so this is presented in case someone else wants to calculate this theory.

"this is presented in case someone else wants to calculate this theory. In the first place the existence of the strange particles shows that the inter­ action between 7T meson and proton is not completely described by this theory, to put it mildly. Secondly the successes of Chew have shown that nature is correctly represented if the interaction is predominately through P waves and the S interaction is extremely small* Yet in this theory almost certainly the S wave will be large. Further Feynman does not like the theory because it is 9so close to electrodynamics; you just replace by *6 ^ and introduce a mass into the propagator and nature certainly has a better imagination than that« Finally all honest attempts to solve this theory which don ft start with perturba­ tion theory and expect to improve on what you start with (which is evidently false with the coupling constant <bfethe order of 10) but start at the other end* fall flat on their face after a few stages, and one comes to the conclusion as Wentzel has that the consequences of this theory, if they could be worked out, would, be completely different from what nature looks like.-?6- The specific approach Feynman reported on was a way to include the contribution due to closed loops before you start the calculation.

This is usually ignored in the Tamm-Dancoff calculations which have been done, but can be handled in the fol­ lowing way. The usual action used in the theory is where the wave function that occurs here is the.wave function customarily used multiplied by the coupling constant of the theory* Usually one starts with this action and then calculates the effect of closed loops; this is equivalent to using another action in calculating without the inclusion of closed loops. Hence if this new action is very different from the old one, this takes the carpet out from under anyone who calculates ignoring any closed loops. Consider for example a particle moving from point 1 to point 2 through a fixed (i.e. not quantized) external field. If we denote the action with no field by T then we have whereby T^ we mean the action with no closed loops present and Here F is the amplitude to go around any loop completely. If <j> is small com­ pared to M, then it is a good approximation to expand in power series in <j> and all the grediant terras are easily included.

The loop contribution is essentially an average of <j) over a region of the order of ^ ,-77- sô that the first approximation is to assume <p~ constant. If one calculates this one obtains The first correction terms due to the gradient are Feynman has also calculated the fourth order corrections, although these were not give n« What are the consequences of having this new action? One had hoped that in some crude sense one would have a new action of the form where g-j aaà^/c^ are new constants; but does the new action in fact look like this?

One finds that in fact the results are very different from what one would hope to find and it is sheer wishful thinking to believe that the next renormalization operation would bring about agreement between the modified action and what we are looking for. If one introduces the cutoff, then the new constants are related to the unrenormalized ones by match­ ing the terms as <j> goes to zero and as the gradient of j> goes to zero* These give the two expressionsHowever if one actually adjusts the new coupling constant in order to fit these equations, then one finds that it is no longer true that to the sixth and higher terms are negligible, that is if you carry out the renormalization you make the original action so small as to allow the correction terms to completely dominate the desired result, and have completely changed the physics of the situation. This situation is illustrated in Table 3 where the renormalized Lagrangian is given for certain order of magnitude for the field and the gradiant of the field in comparison with the various closed loop contributions.

It is clear from this that unless something very peculiar happens with the next renormalization the situation is hopeless. Dyson commented that he had approached the theory of nuclear saturation using very similar ideas and had also run into precisely this kind of situation and these kind of numbers. Feynman summarized by saying, that almost certainly if you permit a cutoff and chcfèe it to be, say, of order of 2M and require g to be positive and allow any theoretical mass, then he believes you can disprove the relativistic $r*meson theory.Peierls reported on some general considerations about what the general features of the propagator in the meson nucléon theory must look like, in par­ ticular as to where its singularities must lie. One knows of course to begin with that it is the function of If p. In the complex plane it has a pole at M, and also at ÏÏ+£jt it must have a branch point, where one is at threshold for single meson production, a branch point at M , which is threshold for double meson production and so on. If the coupling is strong enough so that there are real isobaric states in the theory, then these will contribute either poles or branch points as well depending on what the selection rules are.

If the coupling is strong enough so that there are real isobaric states in the theory, then these will contribute either poles or branch points as well depending on what the selection rules are. What happens if one has virtual isobaric states with a finite lifetime and hence a complex energy? It Would seem obvious, off hand, that these should also give poles in the complex plane. However one has against this the following arguments? that in.the first place the upper half plane is free of poles as Lehmann has proved, and secondly that one can see from the way the'equations look that the whole plane is symmetric about the real axis, so one concludes there can be no poles in the whole complex plane, except along the axis. Thus it seems there are two contradictory conclusions, but these can be reconciled if one remembers that one is dealing with ambiguous functions which involved a square root. While one gets no poles in the functions as they appear in the expressions considered here, if one continues these functions instead on to the other portion of the Reimann surface, it turns out that one indeed finds the poles there corresponding to virtual isobaric states. Some of these poles are fixed and others depend on the resonance levels of the system. It is important to know where these poles"

It is important to know where these poles are, of course, since they can very drastically limit the region in which expansions are possible.—- /ce/-— Peierls then reported on some work of Sal am very briefly, and a more detailed write up is given here. The investigation which I wish to describe started from the work of Edv/ards and Peierls, who set out to solve the functional differential equations proposed by Schwinger (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sciences) for the one particle Green* s Function. They succeeded in obtaining a solution to the equations if all closed loops are neglected. Dr. Mathews and myself tried to include them and found that the simplest procedure is to start from the definition of the Greenes function in terms.of Feynman*s ""sum over paths 11 formulation, rather than from the differential equation approach. In Feynman fs formulation, the Green fs function is defined as The integral on the right denotes summation over all fields I is the total action N is a normalizing constant, which equals <f> and <•/> are to be treated as classical quantities, except that the fermi fields have a prescribed order and two such fields anticommute.

Since in order to use the above approach one needs to know the Greenes function in an arbitrary meson field, this approach would at first sight appear hopeless for an actual calculation, but it is in fact not quite so hopeless as it seems « Starting with the simplest case, that is the netural scalar theory with no recoil, one can in fact obtain the linear differential equation of the first order which, can be solved exactly, and when the solution is introduced into the functional integration, this can also be carried out exactly. This is the only case where this is possible, however. When one looks at the charged scalar theory with no recoil one cannot write down the solution as a function of ^ ; but it is useful introduces a part of the solution as the variable of integration, the integral becomes an explicit functional integral which still cannot be done exactly;, however one can make further algebraic transformations of the remaining variables.

This is another illustration of the fact that when you go into a theory in a violent way with strong renormalization you have no guarantee that the propagator will retain the analytic character which Peierls described and which is needed. Feynman remarked that a student of his had calculated the interaction of scalar nucléons with mass zero scalar mesons, and if the self energy of the nucléon is calculated including recoil but with a cutoff, this self energy goes negative for large coupling constants. lehmann started his presentation by remarking that in spite of the various statements we have had that something is way wrong with the existing field theories, he feels it is important to find out just where the trouble is in order that this part of the theory can be changed if possible.

The problem is complicated since even in the renormalizable theories one has to split off infinite terms* It is therefore difficult to discuss whether solutions to these basic equations exist* He has tried to reformulate the theory so that the theory contains only finiteparameters from the start and no renormalization is necessary. In order to do this, it is necessary to avoid use of the field equations in terms of the Harail« tonian function* In theories with no stable bound states, one can express all relevant quantities by means of the vacuum functions, that is the vacuum expec­ tation values of time ordered operators* Usually one sets up equations for these functions using the field equation and they contain renormalization con~> stants* However Lehmann has found it possible to set up these equations from general requirements of Lorenz invariance the causality requirement^ that is* that the field operators commute at space like points, and an asymptotic con« dition on the matrix elements of the field operator in the remote past and the remote future* The advantage of introducing these assumptions explicitly is that one can then relax on some of them if something goes wrong* Que expects that if these equations for the vacuum functions have solutions at all, they will have very many solutions since the interaction"

Stripped also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, he was awarded the, Enrico Fermi Award, as a gesture of, political rehabilitation, . He died four years later of, throat cancer, . In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance., Early life, Childhood and education, Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer, [note 1], into a, non-observant Jewish, family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer., [5], [6], Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist., [7], Their father was born in, Hanau, then part of the, Hesse-Nassau province, of the, Kingdom of Prussia, and came to the United States as a teenager in 1888 with few resources and no money, higher education, or knowledge of the English language. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy., [8], In 1912, the family moved to an apartment on, Riverside Drive, near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses., [6], Their art collection included works by, Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and, Vincent van Gogh, ., [9], Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School.

In 1911, he entered the, Ethical Culture Society School, [10], founded by, Felix Adler, to promote training based on the, Ethical Culture, movement, whose motto was ""Deed before Creed"". Oppenheimer's father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its board of trustees., [11], Oppenheimer was a versatile student, interested in English and French literature, and particularly, mineralogy, ., [12], He completed third and fourth grades in one year and skipped half of eighth grade., [10], During his final year, Oppenheimer became interested in chemistry., [13], He graduated in 1921, but his further education was delayed a year by an attack of, colitis, contracted while, prospecting, in, Joachimstal, during a family vacation in, Czechoslovakia, . He recovered in, New Mexico, where he developed a love for horseback riding and the southwestern United States., [14], Oppenheimer entered, Harvard College, in 1922 at age 18.

"Oppenheimer entered, Harvard College, in 1922 at age 18. He majored in chemistry; Harvard also required studies in history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. To compensate for the delay caused by his illness, he took six courses each term instead of the usual four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society, Phi Beta Kappa, and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he could bypass basic courses in favor of advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on, thermodynamics, taught by, Percy Bridgman, . Oppenheimer graduated from Harvard in 1925 with a, Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only three years of study., [15], Studies in Europe, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, ' Laboratory in, Leiden, Netherlands, July 1927. Oppenheimer is in the middle row, second from the left., After being accepted at, Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1924, Oppenheimer wrote to, Ernest Rutherford, requesting permission to work at the, Cavendish Laboratory, though Bridgman's letter of recommendation said that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory suggested that theoretical, rather than experimental, physics would be his forte. Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge nonetheless;, [16], J. J. Thomson, ultimately accepted him on the condition that he complete a basic laboratory course., [17], Oppenheimer was very unhappy at Cambridge and wrote to a friend: ""I am having a pretty bad time. The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything""., [18],"

The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything""., [18], He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, Patrick Blackett, a future Nobel laureate. According to Oppenheimer's friend, Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once confessed to leaving an apple injected with poison on Blackett's desk; no one ate it. Oppenheimer's parents convinced the university authorities not to press criminal charges or expel him. Instead Oppenheimer was placed on probation and had to have regular sessions with a psychiatrist in, Harley Street, London., [19], [20], [21], Oppenheimer was a tall, thin, chain smoker, [22], who often neglected to eat during periods of intense concentration. Many friends said he could be self-destructive. Fergusson once tried to distract Oppenheimer from his apparent depression by telling him that he (Fergusson) was to marry his girlfriend; Oppenheimer jumped on Fergusson and tried to strangle him. Oppenheimer was plagued by periods of depression throughout his life, [23], [24], and once told his brother, ""I need physics more than friends""., [25], In 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the, University of Göttingen, to study under, Max Born, ; Göttingen was one of the world's leading centers for theoretical physics.

Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including, Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, and, Edward Teller, . He was enthusiastic in discussion to the point of sometimes taking them over., [26], Maria Goeppert, presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said., [27], Oppenheimer obtained his, Doctor of Philosophy, degree in March 1927 at age 23, supervised by Max Born., [28], [29], After the oral exam, James Franck, the professor administering, reportedly said, ""I'm glad that's over. He was on the point of questioning, me, ."", [30], Oppenheimer published more than a dozen papers while in Europe, including many important contributions to the new field of quantum mechanics. He and Born published a famous paper on the, Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the mathematical treatment of molecules, allowing nuclear motion to be neglected to simplify calculations.

Bridgman also wanted him at Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in 1927 and Caltech in 1928., [32], At Caltech, he struck up a close friendship with, Linus Pauling, ; they planned to mount a joint attack on the nature of the, chemical bond, a field in which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results. The collaboration, and their friendship, ended after Oppenheimer invited Pauling's wife, Ava Helen Pauling, to join him on a tryst in Mexico., [33], Oppenheimer later invited Pauling to be head of the Chemistry Division of the, Manhattan Project, but Pauling refused, saying he was a pacifist., [34], In the autumn of 1928, Oppenheimer visited, Paul Ehrenfest, 's institute at the, University of"

There, he was given the nickname of, Opje, [35], later anglicized by his students as ""Oppie""., [36], From Leiden, he continued on to the, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), in Zurich to work with Wolfgang Pauli on, quantum mechanics, and the, continuous spectrum, . Oppenheimer respected and liked Pauli and may have emulated his personal style as well as his critical approach to problems., [37], On returning to the United States, Oppenheimer accepted an associate professorship from the, University of California, Berkeley, where, Raymond T. Birge, wanted him so badly that he expressed a willingness to share him with Caltech., [34], Before he began his Berkeley professorship, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with a mild case of, tuberculosis, and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at a New Mexico ranch, which he leased and eventually purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease, he exclaimed, ""Hot dog!"", and he later called it, Perro Caliente, (""hot dog"" in Spanish)., [38], Later, he used to say that ""physics and desert country"" were his ""two"

His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other as a pretentious and insecure poseur., [40], His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages., [41], Hans Bethe, said of him:, Probably the most important ingredient he brought to his teaching was his exquisite taste. He always knew what were the important problems, as shown by his choice of subjects. He truly lived with those problems, struggling for a solution, and he communicated his concern to the group.

In its heyday, there were about eight or ten graduate students in his group and about six Post-doctoral Fellows. He met this group once a day in his office and discussed with one after another the status of the student's research problem. He was interested in everything, and in one afternoon they might discuss quantum electrodynamics, cosmic rays, electron pair production and nuclear physics., [42], Oppenheimer worked closely with, Nobel Prize, -winning experimental physicist, Ernest O. Lawrence, and his, cyclotron, pioneers, helping them understand the data that their machines were producing at Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory, which eventually developed into today's, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ., [43], In 1936, Berkeley promoted him to full professor at an annual salary of $3, 300 (equivalent to $70, 000 in 2022). In return, he was asked to curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech., [44], Scientific work, Oppenheimer did important research in, theoretical astronomy, (especially as related to, general relativity, and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and, quantum field theory, including its extension into, quantum electrodynamics, .

The, formal mathematics, of, relativistic, quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, including the, neutron, meson, and, neutron star, ., [45], Initially, his major interest was the theory of the continuous spectrum. His first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its, transition probabilities, . He calculated the, photoelectric effect, for, hydrogen, and, X-rays, obtaining the, absorption coefficient, at the, K-edge, . His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the Sun, but not helium. Years later, it was realized that the Sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were correct., [46], [47], Oppenheimer made important contributions to the theory of, cosmic ray, showers. He also worked on the problem of, field electron emission, ., [48], [49], This work contributed to the development of the concept of, quantum tunneling, ., [50], In 1931, he co-wrote a paper, ""Relativistic Theory of the Photoelectric Effect"", with his student Harvey Hall, [51], in which, based on empirical evidence, he correctly disputed Dirac's assertion that two of the, energy levels, of the, hydrogen atom, have the same energy.

Subsequently, one of his doctoral students, Willis Lamb, determined that this was a consequence of what became known as the, Lamb shift, for which Lamb was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1955., [45], With, Melba Phillips, the first graduate student to begin her PhD under Oppenheimer's supervision, [note 2], Oppenheimer worked on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by, deuterons, . When, Ernest Lawrence, and, Edwin McMillan, bombarded, nuclei, with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of, George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory—subsequently known as the, Oppenheimer–Phillips process, —to explain the results. This theory is still in use today., [53], [note 3], As early as 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper that essentially predicted the existence of the, positron, . This was after a paper by Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, later known as the, Dirac equation, that unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron, spin, to explain the, Zeeman effect, ., [55], Drawing on the body of experimental evidence, Oppenheimer rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged"

He argued that they would have to have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson, discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics., [56], In the late 1930s, Oppenheimer became interested in, astrophysics, most likely through his friendship with, Richard Tolman, resulting in a series of papers. In the first of these, ""On the Stability of Stellar Neutron Cores"" (1938), [57], co-written with, Robert Serber, Oppenheimer explored the properties of, white dwarfs, . This was followed by a paper co-written with one of his students, George Volkoff, ""On Massive Neutron Cores"", [58], which demonstrated that there was a limit, known as the, Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, to the mass of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as, neutron stars, and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, Oppenheimer and another of his students, Hartland Snyder, produced the paper "", On Continued Gravitational Contraction, "", [59], which predicted the existence of what later became termed, black holes, .

After the Born–Oppenheimer approximation paper, these papers remain his most cited, and were key factors in the rejuvenation of astrophysical research in the United States in the 1950s, mainly by, John A. Wheeler, ., [60], Oppenheimer's papers were considered difficult to understand even by the standards of the abstract topics he was expert in. He was fond of using elegant, if extremely complex, mathematical techniques to demonstrate physical principles, though he was sometimes criticized for making mathematical mistakes, presumably out of haste. ""His physics was good"", said his student Snyder, ""but his arithmetic awful""., [45], After, World War II, Oppenheimer published only five scientific papers, one of them in biophysics, and none after 1950., Murray Gell-Mann, a later Nobelist who, as a visiting scientist, worked with him at the, Institute for Advanced Study, in 1951, offered this opinion:, He didn't have, Sitzfleisch, ""sitting flesh, "" when you sit on a chair. As far as I know, he never wrote a long paper or did a long calculation, anything of that kind. He didn't have patience for that; his own work consisted of little, aperçus, but quite brilliant ones.

But he inspired other people to do things, and his influence was fantastic., [61], Private and political life, Oppenheimer in 1946 with his ever-present cigarette, Politics, During the 1920s, Oppenheimer remained uninformed on worldly matters. He claimed that he did not read newspapers or popular magazines and only learned of the, Wall Street crash of 1929, while he was on a walk with Ernest Lawrence six months after the crash occurred., [62], [63], He once remarked that he never cast a vote until the, 1936 presidential election, . From 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs. In 1934, he earmarked three percent of his annual salary—about $100 (equivalent to $2, 200 in 2022)—for two years to support German physicists fleeing, Nazi Germany, . During the, 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike, he and some of his students, including Melba Phillips and Bob Serber, attended a, longshoremen, 's rally.

He donated to many progressive causes considered, left-wing, during the, McCarthy era, . Most of his allegedly radical work consisted of hosting fundraisers for the, Republican, cause in the, Spanish Civil War, and other, anti-fascist, activity. He never openly joined the, Communist Party USA, (CPUSA), though he did give money to leftist causes by way of acquaintances who were alleged to be members., [67], When he joined the Manhattan Project in 1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he had been ""a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the, West Coast, ""., [68], Years later, he claimed that he did not remember saying this, that it was not true, and that if he had said anything along those lines, it"

It recorded that he attended a meeting in December 1940 at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary, William Schneiderman, and its treasurer, Isaac Folkoff, . The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the, American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a communist front organization. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its, Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency., [75], Many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active in the Communist Party in the 1930s or 1940s, including his brother Frank, Frank's wife Jackie, [76], Kitty, [77], Tatlock, his landlady Mary Ellen Washburn, [78],"

Almost all historians agree he had strong left-wing views during this time and interacted with party members, but it is disputed whether he was an official member. At his 1954 security clearance hearings, he denied being a member of the Communist Party but identified himself as a, fellow traveler, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of communism's goals but is not willing to blindly follow orders from any Communist Party apparatus., [80], Relationships and children, In 1936, Oppenheimer became involved with, Jean Tatlock, the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at, Stanford University School of Medicine, .

Actually, he was engaged in a very difficult calculation of the opacity of surfaces of stars to their internal radiation, an important constant in the theoretical construction of stellar models. He spoke little of these problems and seemed to be much more interested in literature, especially the Hindu classics and the more esoteric Western writers., Pauli, once remarked to me that Oppenheimer seemed to treat physics as an avocation and psychoanalysis as a vocation., —, I.

He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was ... [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.... In Oppenheimer the element of earthiness was feeble. Yet it was essentially this spiritual quality, this refinement as expressed in speech and manner, that was the basis of his charisma. He never expressed himself completely. He always left a feeling that there were depths of sensibility and insight not yet revealed.

On May 18, 1942, [112], National Defense Research Committee, Chairman, James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on, fast neutron, calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, Emil Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb., [113], [114], Oppenheimer's ID photo from the, Los Alamos Laboratory, In June 1942, the, U.S. Army, established the, Manhattan Engineer District, to handle its part in the atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the, Office of Scientific Research and Development, to the military., [115], In September, Brigadier General, Leslie R.

"In September, Brigadier General, Leslie R. Groves Jr., was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project., [116], By October 12, 1942, Groves and Oppenheimer had decided that for security and cohesion, they needed to establish a centralized, secret research laboratory in a remote location., [117], Groves selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons laboratory, although it is not known precisely when., [118], This decision surprised many, because Oppenheimer had left-wing political views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves worried that because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists, [119], but Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a, military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, and, engineering, . Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an ""overweening ambition"", [120], which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion., [120], Oppenheimer's past associations were not overlooked, but on July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security clearance ""without delay irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr Oppenheimer.

On November 16, 1942, he, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he knew well: a flat, mesa, near, Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was the site of a private boys' school, the, Los Alamos Ranch School, . The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply but otherwise felt that it was ideal., [123], The, Los Alamos Laboratory, was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings were erected in great haste. At the laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top physicists of the time, whom he called the ""luminaries""., [124], Los Alamos was initially supposed to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army.

He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at 128 pounds (58 kg), diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis, and were concerned about his chronic, lumbosacral joint, pain., [125], The plan to commission scientists fell through when Rabi and, Robert Bacher, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the University of California operated the laboratory under contract to the, War Department, ., [126], It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project: Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6, 000 in 1945., [125], Oppenheimer at first had difficulty with the organizational division of large groups but rapidly learned the art of large-scale administration after he took up permanent residence at Los Alamos. He was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and the military., Victor Weisskopf, wrote:, Oppenheimer directed these studies, theoretical and experimental, in the real sense of the words.

Here his uncanny speed in grasping the main points of any subject was a decisive factor; he could acquaint himself with the essential details of every part of the work., He did not direct from the head office. He was intellectually and physically present at each decisive step. He was present in the laboratory or in the seminar rooms, when a new effect was measured, when a new idea was conceived. It was not that he contributed so many ideas or suggestions; he did so sometimes, but his main influence came from something else. It was his continuous and intense presence, which produced a sense of direct participation in all of us; it created that unique atmosphere of enthusiasm and challenge that pervaded the place throughout its time., [127], Bomb design, Leslie Groves, military head of the Manhattan Project, with Oppenheimer in 1942, At this point in the war, there was considerable anxiety among the scientists that the, German nuclear weapons program, might be progressing faster than the Manhattan Project., [128], [129], In a letter dated May 25, 1943, Oppenheimer responded to a proposal by Fermi to use radioactive materials to poison German food supplies.

Oppenheimer continued, ""I think we should not attempt a plan unless we can poison food sufficient to kill a half a million men""., [130], In 1943, development efforts were directed to a, plutonium, gun-type fission weapon, called "", Thin Man, "". Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated, plutonium-239, which was extremely pure but could be created only in tiny amounts. When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the, X-10 Graphite Reactor, in April 1944, a problem was discovered: reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of, plutonium-240, making it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon., [131], In July 1944, Oppenheimer abandoned the gun design in favor of an, implosion-type, weapon. Using chemical, explosive lenses, a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form. The metal needed to travel only very short distances, so the critical mass would be assembled in much less time., [132], In August 1944, Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion., [133], He concentrated the development efforts on the gun-type device, a simpler design that only had to work with, uranium-235, in a single group.

This device became, Little Boy, in February 1945., [134], After a mammoth research effort, the more complex design of the implosion device, known as the ""Christy gadget"" after, Robert Christy, another student of Oppenheimer's, [135], was finalized in a meeting in Oppenheimer's office on February 28, 1945., [136], In May 1945, an, Interim Committee, was created to advise and report on wartime and postwar policies regarding the use of nuclear energy. The Interim Committee established a scientific panel consisting of Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton, Fermi, and Lawrence to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the panel offered its opinion not just on an atomic bomb's likely physical effects but also on its likely military and political impact., [137], This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan., [138], Trinity, Main article:, Trinity (nuclear test), The, Trinity test, was the first detonation of a nuclear device., [139], In the early morning hours of July 16, 1945, near, Alamogordo, New Mexico, the work at Los Alamos culminated in the test of the world's first,"

He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself. For the last few seconds, he stared directly ahead and then when the announcer shouted ""Now!"" and there came this tremendous burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief., [142], Oppenheimer's brother Frank recalled Oppenheimer's first words as, ""I guess it worked""., [143], [144], External video, Oppenheimer recalling his thoughts after witnessing the Trinity test, Oppenheimer and Groves at the remains of the Trinity test tower.

Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds."", [146], In 1965 he recalled the moment this way:, We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent.

He expressed regret that the weapon was ready too late for use against Nazi Germany., [156], On August 17, however, Oppenheimer traveled to Washington to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned., [157], In October he met with President, Harry S. Truman, who dismissed Oppenheimer's concern about an arms race with the, Soviet Union, and belief that atomic energy should be under international control. Truman became infuriated when Oppenheimer said, ""Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands"", responding that he (Truman) bore sole responsibility for the decision to use atomic weapons against Japan, and later said, ""I don't want to see that son of a bitch in this office ever again""., [158], [159], For his services as director of Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was awarded the, Medal for Merit, by Truman in 1946., [160], Postwar activities, Once the public learned of the Manhattan Project after"

He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including, Freeman Dyson, and the duo of, Chen Ning Yang, and, Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of, parity, non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as, T. S. Eliot, and, George F. Kennan, .

Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities., [171], During a series of conferences in New York from 1947 through 1949, physicists transitioned from war work back to theoretical issues. Under Oppenheimer's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problem of the pre-war years: infinite, divergent, and seemingly nonsensical expressions in the quantum electrodynamics of, elementary particles, ., Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and, Shin'ichiro Tomonaga, tackled the problem of, regularization, and developed techniques that became known as, renormalization, . Freeman Dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of meson absorption and, Hideki Yukawa, 's theory of mesons as the carrier particles of the, strong nuclear force, were also tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted, Robert Marshak, 's innovative two-meson, hypothesis, : that there are actually two types of mesons, pions, and, muons, . This led to, Cecil Frank Powell, 's breakthrough and subsequent Nobel Prize for the discovery of the pion., [172], [note 6], Oppenheimer served as director of the institute until 1966, when he gave up the position due to his failing health., [174], As of 2023, [update], he is the longest-serving director of the institute., [175], Atomic"

In this report, the committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production., Bernard Baruch, was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the, Baruch Plan, of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. It was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, [176], which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust., [177], After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research"

From this position, he advised on a number of nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded., [178], As chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race., [179], The, first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union, in August 1949 came earlier than Americans expected, and over the next several months, there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities over whether to proceed with the development of the far more powerful, nuclear fusion, -based, hydrogen bomb, then known as ""the Super""., [180], Oppenheimer had been aware of the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon since the days of the Manhattan Project and had allocated a limited amount of theoretical research work toward the possibility at the time, but nothing more than that, given the pressing need to develop a fission weapon., [181], Immediately following the end of the war, Oppenheimer argued against continuing work"

Strauss pressed for Oppenheimer's security clearance to be revoked., The FBI under, J. Edgar Hoover, had been following Oppenheimer since before the war, when he showed Communist sympathies as a professor at Berkeley and had been close to members of the Communist Party, including his wife and brother. They strongly suspected that he himself was a member of the party, based on wiretaps in which party members referred to him or appeared to refer to him as a communist, as well as reports from informers within the party., [226], He had been under close surveillance since the early 1940s, his home and office bugged, his phone tapped and his mail opened., [227], In August 1943, Oppenheimer told Manhattan Project security agents that, George Eltenton, whom he did not know, had solicited three men at Los Alamos for nuclear secrets on behalf of the, Soviet"

When pressed on the issue in later interviews, Oppenheimer admitted that the only person who had approached him was his friend, Haakon Chevalier, a Berkeley professor of French literature, who had mentioned the matter privately at a dinner at Oppenheimer's house., [228], The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with evidence that intimated communist ties. These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier. Strauss had expressed opposition to exporting radioactive isotopes to other nations, and Oppenheimer had called them ""less important than electronic devices but more important than, let us say, vitamins""., [229], On June 7, 1949, Oppenheimer testified before the, House Un-American Activities Committee, that he had associations with the Communist Party USA in the 1930s., [230], He testified that some of his students, including, David Bohm, Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz, Philip Morrison, Bernard Peters, and, Joseph Weinberg, had been communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley.

He later taught high school physics and was the founder of the San Francisco, Exploratorium, ., [79], [231], The triggering event for the security hearing happened on November 7, 1953, [232], when, William Liscum Borden, who until earlier in the year had been the executive director of the, United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, sent Hoover a letter saying that ""more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union""., [233], Eisenhower never exactly believed the allegations in the letter but felt compelled to move forward with an investigation, [234], and on December 3, he ordered that a ""blank wall"" be placed between Oppenheimer and any government or military secrets., [235], On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning by way of requesting termination of his consulting contract with the AEC., [236], Oppenheimer"

Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime., [248], Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal to the U.S. government, but that:, In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act—I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted—in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand.

To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more. In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands., [249], Teller's testimony outraged the scientific community, and he was virtually ostracized from academic science., [250], Ernest Lawrence refused to testify, pleading an attack of ulcerative colitis, but an interview in which Lawrence condemned Oppenheimer was submitted in evidence., [251], Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Physicist, Isidor Isaac Rabi, said that the suspension of the security clearance was unnecessary: ""he is a consultant, and if you don't want to consult the guy, you don't consult him, period."", [252], But Groves testified that, under the stricter security criteria in effect in 1954, he ""would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today""., [253], At the conclusion of the hearings, the board revoked Oppenheimer's clearance by a 2–1 vote., [254], It unanimously cleared him of disloyalty, but a majority found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true"

He did not comment on Oppenheimer's loyalty., [257], During his hearing, Oppenheimer testified willingly on the left-wing activities of many of his colleagues. Had his clearance not been stripped, he might have been remembered as someone who ""named names"" to save his own reputation, [258], but as it happened, most in the scientific community saw him as a martyr to McCarthyism, an eclectic liberal unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific work from academia into the military., [259], Wernher von Braun, told a Congressional committee: ""In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted""., [260], In a seminar at, The Wilson Center, in 2009, based on an extensive analysis of the, Vassiliev notebooks, taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey"

Further, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union., [261], Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state Oppenheimer ""was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s""., [262], According to biographer, Ray Monk, : ""He was, in a very practical and real sense, a supporter of the Communist Party.

He joined with, Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat, and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually, in 1960, become the, World Academy of Art and Science, . Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the, Russell–Einstein Manifesto, of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first, Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, in 1957., [275], In his speeches and public writings, Oppenheimer continually stressed the difficulty of managing the power of knowledge in a world in which the freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer delivered the, Reith Lectures, on the, BBC, in 1953, which were subsequently published as, Science and the Common Understanding, ., [276], In 1955, Oppenheimer published, The Open Mind, a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 on the subject of nuclear weapons and popular culture., [277], Oppenheimer rejected the idea of nuclear, gunboat diplomacy, .

At the event, AEC chairman, Glenn Seaborg, asked Oppenheimer whether he wanted another security hearing. Oppenheimer declined., [287], In March 1963, the General Advisory committee of the AEC selected Oppenheimer to receive its, Enrico Fermi Award, an award Congress had created in 1954., [287], Kennedy was assassinated, before he could present the award to Oppenheimer, but his successor, Lyndon Johnson, did so in a December 1963 ceremony at which he cited Oppenheimer's ""contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, [and] leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years""., [288], He called the signing of the award one of Kennedy's greatest acts as president., [289], Oppenheimer told Johnson, ""I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that"

Smyth, who in 1954 had been the lone dissenter from the AEC's 4–1 decision to define Oppenheimer as a security risk., But congressional hostility to Oppenheimer lingered. Senator, Bourke B. Hickenlooper, formally protested Oppenheimer's selection just eight days after Kennedy was killed, [287], and several Republican members of the House AEC Committee boycotted the ceremony., [292], The rehabilitation represented by the award was symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50, 000 tax-free stipend., [289], Death, A chain smoker, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with, throat cancer, in late 1965.

The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not improve Western security and that, using the weapon against large civilian populations, would be, genocide, ; they advocated instead a more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control agreements. The first of these groups was the more powerful in political terms, and Oppenheimer became its target., [302], [303], Rather than consistently oppose the ""Red-baiting"" of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against former colleagues and students, before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end, it became a liability when it became clear Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters's loyalty, and recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory., [304], Popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (represented by Teller) and left-wing"

All these, in different ways, were turned against him in the hearings."", [308], The question of scientists' responsibility toward humanity inspired, Bertolt Brecht, 's drama, Life of Galileo, (1955), left its imprint on, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, 's, The Physicists, and is the basis of, John Adams, 's 2005 opera, Doctor Atomic, which was commissioned to portray Oppenheimer as a modern-day, Faust, . Heinar Kipphardt's play, In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer, after appearing on West German television, had its theatrical release in Berlin and Munich in October 1964.

Oppenheimer's objections resulted in an exchange of correspondence with Kipphardt, in which Kipphardt offered to make corrections but defended the play., [309], It premiered in New York in 1968, with, Joseph Wiseman, as Oppenheimer., New York Times, theater critic, Clive Barnes, called it an ""angry play and a partisan play"" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed him as a ""tragic fool and genius""., [310], Oppenheimer had difficulty with this portrayal. After reading a transcript of Kipphardt's play soon after it began to be performed, Oppenheimer threatened to sue Kipphardt, decrying ""improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved""., [311], Later Oppenheimer told an interviewer:, The whole damn thing [his security hearing] was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it. ... I had never said that I had regretted participating in a responsible way in the making of the bomb. I said that perhaps he [Kipphardt] had forgotten, Guernica, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, Dachau, Warsaw, and, Tokyo, ; but I had not, and that if he found it so difficult to understand, he should write a play about something else., [312], Oppenheimer is the subject of many biographies, including, American Prometheus, (2005) by, Kai Bird, and, Martin J.

""More than any other man"", Bethe wrote, ""he was responsible for raising American theoretical physics from a provincial adjunct of Europe to world leadership""., [324], Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, [325], though his investigations contributing to the theory of black holes might have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought to fruition by later astrophysicists., [106], An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor on January 4, 2000, [326], as was the lunar crater, Oppenheimer, in 1970., [327], As a military and public policy advisor, Oppenheimer was a leader in the shift toward, technocracy, in the interactions between science and the military, and in the emergence of "", big science, "".

As a cultured, intellectual, theoretical physicist who became a disciplined military organizer, Oppenheimer represented the shift away from the idea that scientists had their ""heads in the clouds"" and that knowledge of esoteric subjects like the composition of the atomic nucleus had no ""real-world"" applications., [300], Two days before the Trinity test, Oppenheimer expressed his hopes and fears in a quotation from, Bhartṛhari, 's, Śatakatraya, :, In battle, in the forest, at the precipice in the mountains, On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows, In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame, The good deeds a man has done before defend him., [328], [329], Publications, Oppenheimer, J.

"the, United Kingdom, and with support from, Canada, . From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General, Leslie Groves, of the, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, . The nuclear physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, was the director of the, Los Alamos Laboratory, that designed the bombs. The Army component was designated the, Manhattan District, as its first headquarters were in, Manhattan, ; the name gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. The project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys, . The Manhattan Project grew rapidly and employed nearly 130, 000 people at its peak and cost nearly US$2 billion (equivalent to about $24 billion in 2021)., [1], Over 90 percent of the cost was for building factories and to produce, fissile material, with less than 10 percent for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada., The project led to the development of two types of atomic bombs, both developed concurrently, during the war: a relatively simple, gun-type fission weapon, and a more complex, implosion-type nuclear weapon, . The, Thin Man, gun-type design proved impractical to use with, plutonium, so a simpler gun-type design called, Little Boy, was developed that used, uranium-235, .

Three methods were employed for, uranium enrichment, :, electromagnetic, gaseous, and, thermal, . In parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, the, Chicago Pile-1, was demonstrated in 1942 at the, Metallurgical Laboratory, in the, University of Chicago, the project designed the, X-10 Graphite Reactor, and the production reactors at the, Hanford Site, in which uranium was irradiated and, transmuted, into plutonium. The, Fat Man, plutonium implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory., The project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the, German nuclear weapon project, . Through, Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet, atomic spies, successfully penetrated the program., The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb during the, Trinity test, conducted at New Mexico's, Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, on 16 July 1945.

In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at, Bikini Atoll, as part of, Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of, national laboratories, supported medical research into, radiology, and laid the foundations for the, nuclear navy, . It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the, United States Atomic Energy Commission, (UNAEC) in January 1947., Origins, For a chronological guide, see, Timeline of the Manhattan Project, ., The, discovery of nuclear fission, by German chemists, Otto Hahn, and, Fritz Strassmann, in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by, Lise Meitner, and, Otto Frisch, made the development of an, atomic bomb, a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a, German atomic bomb project, would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from, Nazi Germany, and other, fascist, countries., [2], In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists, Leo Szilard, and, Eugene Wigner, drafted the, Einstein–Szilard letter, which warned of the potential development of ""extremely powerful bombs of a new type"".

He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as advanced., [17], As part of the scientific exchange, the MAUD Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist, Mark Oliphant, flew to the US in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the MAUD Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited, Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to, Ernest O. Lawrence, . Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to, James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton, and, George B. Pegram, .

They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible., [29], The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, which had only been discovered in February 1941 by, Glenn Seaborg, and his team. The scientists at the July 1942 Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from, cyclotrons, ., [30], Even by December 1943, only two milligrams had been produced., [31], There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a ""cylindrical plug"" into a sphere of ""active material"" with a ""tamper""—dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency., [32], They also explored designs involving, spheroids, a primitive form of "", implosion, "" suggested by, Richard C. Tolman, and the possibility of, autocatalytic methods, which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded., [33], As the idea of the fission bomb was theoretically settled—at least until more experimental data was available—Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the ""super"", now usually referred to as a "", hydrogen bomb, "", which would use the"

The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs., [35], Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might ""ignite"" the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei., [note 2], Bethe calculated that it could not happen, [37], and a report co-authored by Teller showed that ""no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started."", [38], In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned the possibility of this scenario to, Arthur Compton, who ""didn't have enough sense to shut up about it.

The first step was to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel, Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose., [48], Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania., [49], Military Policy Committee, Oppenheimer, and Groves at the remains of the, Trinity test, in September 1945, two months after the test blast and just after the end of World War II.

It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944., [58], According to Groves, ""In Washington you became aware of the importance of top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority""., [59], One of Groves' early problems was to find a director for, Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared.

However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were, communists, including his wife, Kitty, ; his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock, ; and his brother, Frank, . A long conversation in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director.

Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity., [143], Alpha I racetrack at Y-12, Marshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require 5, 000 short tons (4, 500 tonnes) of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 copper:silver ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with, Under Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel W.

Gladys Owens, seated in the foreground, was unaware of what she had been involved in., [149], Responsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called, Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943., [150], The second Alpha I was operational at the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944., [151], Tennessee Eastman, was contracted to manage Y-12., [152], The calutrons were turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators known as the, Calutron Girls, ., [153], The calutrons initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944.

Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant, and the next month they received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August, K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks., [154], Gaseous diffusion, Main article:, K-25, The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion., Graham's law, states that the rate of, effusion, of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its, molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture.

Kellogg, accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project., [157], The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps had to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which had to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the, Bell Telephone Laboratories, and the, Bakelite, Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production., [158], [159], Kellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story 0.5-mile (0.80 km) long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections containing cells of six stages. A survey party began construction by marking out the 500-acre (2.0 km, 2, ) site in May 1943.

In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, Union Carbide, and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480 million., [160], The production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2, 892 stages commenced operation.

This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part., [163], The Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when, Captain, William S.

Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (690 kPa) and temperature of 545 °F (285 °C), flowed downward through the innermost 1.25-inch (32 mm) nickel pipe, while water at 155 °F (68 °C) flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. The uranium hexafluoride flowed in the middle copper pipe, and isotope separation of the uranium occurred between the nickel and copper pipes., [166], Work commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 the S-50 plant produced 12, 730 pounds (5, 770 kg) of slightly enriched product., [167], By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series.

They were, pickled, to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and, aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using, arc welding, under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were tested to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start, Reactor B, on schedule in August 1944., [177], Work began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250 MW reactors, on 10 October 1943., [178], The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites developed first, as this maximized the distance between the reactors.

Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the, control rods, to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely.

The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%., [174], At Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials., [189], Early plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East.

The canyons were each 800 feet (240 m) long and 65 feet (20 m) wide.

The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive.

Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. The critical mass is assembled in much less time than with the gun method. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, [196], so it also makes more efficient use of the fissionable material., [197], Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations showed promise, but also made it clear that an implosion weapon was more complex than the gun-type design from both a theoretical and an engineering perspective., [198], In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with, shaped charges, proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on., [199], An implosion-type nuclear bomb, An accelerated effort on the implosion design, codenamed, Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion., [200], Two new groups were created at Los Alamos"

Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300 °C to 450 °C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with, alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon using a, plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be, hot pressed, into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel., [214], The work proved dangerous. By the end of the war,"

By the end of the war, half the chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element was detected in their urine., [215], A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site., [216], The hemispheres for the first plutonium, pit, (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later., [217], In contrast to the plutonium Fat Man, the uranium gun-type Little Boy weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. Overall responsibility for it was assigned to Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division, with the design, development, and technical work at Los Alamos consolidated under, Lieutenant Commander, Francis Birch, 's group.

It was fabricated at great expense from 214 short tons (194 t) of iron and steel., [225], By the time it arrived, however, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower 800 yards (730 m) from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a, fizzled explosion, ., [226], [223], The, Trinity test, of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a, nuclear weapon, ., For the actual test, the weapon, nicknamed ""the gadget"", was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot (30 m) steel tower, as detonation at that height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber. Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target, and generated less, nuclear fallout, .

The shock wave was felt over 100 miles (160 km) away, and the, mushroom cloud, reached 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in height. It was heard as far away as, El Paso, Texas, so Groves issued a cover story about an ammunition magazine explosion at Alamogordo Field involving gas shells., [228], [229], Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the, Hindu, holy book, the, Bhagavad Gita, (XI, 12):, कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो लोकान्समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः। ऋतेऽपि त्वां न भविष्यन्ति सर्वे येऽवस्थिताः प्रत्यनीकेषु योधाः॥११- ३२॥, If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one ..., [230], [231], together with verse (XI, 32), which he translated, ""Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds""., [232], [233], Personnel, At its peak in June 1944, the Manhattan Project employed about 129, 000 workers, of whom 84, 500 were construction workers, 40, 500 were plant operators and 1, 800 were military personnel."

As construction activity declined, the workforce fell to 100, 000 a year later, but the number of military personnel increased to 5, 600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult., [234], Due to high turnover, over 500, 000 people worked on the project., [235], In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the, War Manpower Commission, . In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority., [236], The Kansas commission director stated that from April to July 1944 every qualified applicant in the state who visited a, United States Employment Service, office was urged to work at the Hanford Site.

Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos., [241], The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials., [242], Yet in December 1945, the, National Safety Council, presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record.

In April 1942 nuclear physicist, Georgy Flyorov, wrote to, Josef Stalin, on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project., [250], The Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project., [251], The Office of Censorship relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office.

This marked the end of his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-communist, McCarthyism, ., Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated back to the 1930s, when he was a member of numerous, Communist front, organizations, and was associated with, Communist Party USA, members, including his wife, brother and sister-in-law. These associations were known to, Army Counterintelligence, at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity, Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the, hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner, Lewis Strauss, ., The proceedings were initiated after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily give up his security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire at the end of June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two-to-one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire.

As a result of the two-to-one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated., The loss of his security clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations of those who had testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, though Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents, John F. Kennedy, and, Lyndon B. Johnson, . The brief period when scientists were viewed as a ""public policy priesthood"" ended, and thereafter would serve the state only to offer narrow scientific opinions. Scientists working in government were on notice that, dissent, was no longer tolerated., The fairness of the proceedings has been a subject of controversy, and on December 16, 2022, United States Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, nullified the 1954 decision, saying that it had been the result of a ""flawed process"" and affirming that Oppenheimer had been loyal., Background, [, edit, ], Before, World War II, J.

In a 1930 paper on the, Dirac equation, he had predicted the existence of the, positron, . A 1938 paper co-written with, Robert Serber, explored the properties of, white dwarf, stars. This was followed by one co-written with one of his students, George Volkoff, in which they demonstrated that there was a limit, the so-called, Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, to the, mass, of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as, neutron stars, and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, with another of his students, Hartland Snyder, he went further and predicted the existence of what are today known as, black holes, .

In 1939, with another of his students, Hartland Snyder, he went further and predicted the existence of what are today known as, black holes, . It would be decades before the significance of this was appreciated., [6], Still, Oppenheimer was not well known before the war, and certainly not as renowned as his friend and colleague, Ernest O. Lawrence, who was awarded the, Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1939 for his invention of the, cyclotron, . But as an experimental physicist, Lawrence had come to rely on Oppenheimer, [7], [8], and it was Lawrence who brought Oppenheimer into the effort to develop an, atomic bomb, which became known as the, Manhattan Project, ., [9], Brigadier General, Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who became director of the Manhattan Project on September 8, 1942, met Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where Oppenheimer briefed Groves on the work done so far on the "", Super, "" (thermonuclear) bomb. Oppenheimer told Groves on October 8 that the Manhattan Project needed a dedicated weapons development laboratory. Groves agreed, and after a second meeting with Oppenheimer on a train on October 15, decided that Oppenheimer was the man he needed to head what became the, Los Alamos Laboratory, despite Oppenheimer's lack of a Nobel Prize or administrative experience., [10], [11], The end of the war in the wake of the, atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, made scientists into heroes.

Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the, American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a, Communist front, .

"Roger S. Warner, In January or February 1943, Chevalier had a brief conversation with Oppenheimer in the kitchen of his home. Chevalier told Oppenheimer that there was a scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the, Soviet Union, ., [17], Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for, Shell Oil, and who had, Communist, connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank., [18], In any case, Groves had considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over any suspicious behavior. He had ordered on July 20, 1943 that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance ""without delay, irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer.

He related the ""Chevalier incident"", and he gave contradictory and equivocating statements, telling government agents that only he had been approached, by Chevalier, who at the time had supposedly said that he had a potential conduit through Eltenton for information which could be passed to the Soviets. Oppenheimer claimed to have invented the other contacts to conceal the identity of Chevalier, whose identity he believed would be immediately apparent if he named only one contact, but whom he believed to be innocent of any disloyalty. The 1943 fabrication and the shifting nature of his accounts figured prominently in the 1954 inquiry., [20], [21], The, McMahon Act, that established the, Atomic Energy Commission, (AEC) required all employees holding wartime security clearances issued by the Manhattan Project to be investigated by the, FBI, and re-certified., [22], This provision had come in the wake of the February 16, 1946 announcement in Canada of the arrest of 22 people exposed as a consequence of the defection the previous September of Soviet cipher clerk, Igor Gouzenko, ., [23], President, Harry S.

These included, Lewis Strauss, [28], an AEC commissioner who resented Oppenheimer for his humiliation before Congress regarding opposition to the export of, radioactive isotopes, to other nations, which Strauss believed had military applications. As GAC chairman, Oppenheimer was called before the, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, (JCAE) over the issue in June 1949.

The other four AEC commissioners had opposed Strauss, so he had gone to the JCAE in an attempt to get the decision overturned., [29], The result was a stunning humiliation for the thin-skinned Strauss., [29], Oppenheimer testified that:, No one can force me to say that you cannot use these isotopes for atomic energy. You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do. You can use a bottle of beer for atomic energy, in fact you do. But to get some perspective, the fact is that during the war and after the war these materials played no significant part, and in my knowledge, no part at all ... My own rating of the importance of isotopes in this broad sense is that they are far less important than electronic devices but far more important than, let us say, vitamins, somewhere in between., [30], This came on the heels of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, including, David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz, and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the, House Un-American Activities Committee, (HUAC), where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them."

Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer., [31], Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in, Colorado, ., [32], Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco, Exploratorium, in 1969., [33], David Kaiser, noted that:, These dozen or so theoretical physicists surely came under fire for many reasons; with hindsight their troubles appear almost overdetermined. Most were Jewish; several had been active in labor organizing before or during the war; a few had flirted with the Communist Party in their youth; many were active in other leftwing political organizations after the war. Perhaps most important, however, they had close and long-standing ties with Robert Oppenheimer ..., [34], Edward Teller, who clashed with Oppenheimer on the H-bomb, testified against him., From 1949 to 1953, Oppenheimer had also found himself in the middle of a controversy over the development of the ""Super"".

In 1949, the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb. This came as a shock to many Americans, and it fell to Oppenheimer to play a leading role in checking the evidence and confirming that the explosion had taken place., [35], In response, Strauss recommended that the United States retain nuclear superiority by developing the ""Super""., [36], This had been under consideration at Los Alamos for several years. Brigadier General, James McCormack, told the AEC commissioners that while thermonuclear weapons could potentially be thousands of times as powerful as fission weapons, as of 1949 there was no design that worked, and no certainty that a practical bomb could be built if there was one. He cautioned that the ""Super"" would probably require large amounts of, tritium, which could only be acquired by diverting the AEC's, nuclear reactors, from, plutonium, production., [37], Strauss found allies in Lawrence and, Edward Teller, who had headed the ""Super"" group at Los Alamos during the war., [38], When the matter was referred to the GAC, it unanimously voted against a, crash program, to develop the ""Super"".

In projects and study groups such as, Project Vista, and the, Lincoln Summer Study Group, however, Oppenheimer pushed for smaller ""tactical"" nuclear weapons that would be more useful against enemy troops in a limited theater conflict and which would be under control of the Army.

The letter concluded:, 1. Between 1939 and mid-1942, more probably than not, J.

Oppenheimer and Garrison also breached the confidentiality of the hearing, by communicating with, The New York Times, journalist, James Reston, who wrote an article on the hearing that appeared on the second day of the hearing., [67], Garrison applied for an emergency security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted during the course of the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see.

"prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted during the course of the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's attorneys. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status., [68], The AEC's former general counsel Joseph Volpe had urged Oppenheimer to retain a tough litigator as his attorney; Garrison's demeanor was gentle and cordial, but Robb was adversarial. Garrison voluntarily provided the board and Robb with a list of his witnesses, but Robb refused to extend the same courtesy. This gave Robb a clear advantage in his cross-examination of Oppenheimer's witnesses., [69], One observer commented that Robb ""did not treat Oppenheimer as a witness in his own case, but as a person charged with high treason."", [70], Members of the hearing panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the contents of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946, Administrative Procedure Act, included a legal principle known as ""the exclusivity of the record"" or the "", blank pad rule, "".

"the hearing to review the contents of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946, Administrative Procedure Act, included a legal principle known as ""the exclusivity of the record"" or the "", blank pad rule, "". This meant that a hearing could only consider information that had been formally presented under the established rules of evidence. However, while the act applied to the courts and to administrative hearings held by agencies like the, Federal Trade Commission, and, Federal Communications Commission, it did not apply to the AEC. Garrison asked for the opportunity to review the file with the panel, but this was rejected., [71], Scope of testimony, [, edit, ], As outlined in the 3, 500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser., [72], Nobel Prize–winning physicist, Enrico Fermi, was among the eminent scientists who testified in support of Oppenheimer., Oppenheimer testified for a total of 27 hours. His demeanor was very different from his previous interrogations, such as his appearance before HUAC. Under cross-examination by Robb, who had access to top-secret information such as surveillance recordings, Oppenheimer was ""often anguished, sometimes surprisingly inarticulate, frequently apologetic about his past and even self-castigating."", [73], One of"

Under cross-examination by Robb, who had access to top-secret information such as surveillance recordings, Oppenheimer was ""often anguished, sometimes surprisingly inarticulate, frequently apologetic about his past and even self-castigating."", [73], One of the key elements in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before, and he was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts that he had no chance to review. Under questioning by Robb, he admitted that he had lied to, Boris Pash, an Army counterintelligence officer, concerning the approach from Chevalier. Asked why he had fabricated a story that three people had been approached for espionage, Oppenheimer responded, ""Because I was an idiot."", [74], Much of the questioning of Oppenheimer concerned his role in the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and, Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party., [75], The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds of"
"and, Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party., [75], The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds of the review panel., [76], Groves, testifying as a witness for the AEC and against Oppenheimer, reaffirmed his decision to hire Oppenheimer. Groves said that Oppenheimer's refusal to report Chevalier was ""the typical American school boy attitude that there is something wicked about telling on a friend."" Under questioning from Robb, Groves said that under the security criteria in effect in 1954, he ""would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today""., [77], The official position of the Air Force was to support the suspension of the security clearance, which was given during testimony by its chief scientist, David T. Griggs, . Although his testimony was not pivotal in the decision, many physicists viewed Griggs as the ""Judas who had betrayed their god"", the brilliant theoretical physicist who led the successful wartime development of the atomic bomb., [78], Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Among them were Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hans Bethe, John J. McCloy, James B. Conant, and Bush, as well as two former AEC chairmen and three former commissioners., [79], Also testifying on behalf of Oppenheimer was Lansdale, who was involved in the Army's surveillance"

He testified that Oppenheimer was not a Communist, and that he was ""loyal and discreet""., [81], Ernest Lawrence was known to dislike political activities, seeing them as a waste of time better spent on scientific research. He did not oppose the investigations of Oppenheimer or others, tending to distance himself from those under investigation rather than supporting them., [82], He said he was unable to testify at the Oppenheimer hearing because of illness. On April 26, Lawrence suffered a severe colitis attack. The next day, Lawrence called Lewis Strauss and told him that his brother, a doctor, had ordered him to return home and that he would not be testifying., [83], Lawrence suffered with colitis until his death during colostomy surgery, on August 27, 1958., [84], [85], However, an interview transcript in which Lawrence stated that Oppenheimer ""should never again have anything to do with the forming of policy"" was presented at the hearing, and several other members of Lawrence's, Radiation Laboratory, did testify against Oppenheimer in person.

This resulted in later ill-feeling from the scientific community towards Lawrence and other members of his laboratory., [82], Edward Teller was opposed to the hearing, feeling it was improper to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that ""in a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more."" Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that ""if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance."", [86], This led to outrage by many in"

Gray and Morgan voted in favor, Evans against. The board rendered its decision on May 27, 1954, in a 15, 000-word letter to Nichols. It found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially true. The board found that while he had been opposed to the H-bomb and that his lack of enthusiasm for it had affected the attitude of other scientists, he had not actively discouraged scientists from working on the H-bomb, as had been alleged in Nichols' letter. It found that ""there is no evidence that he was a member of the [Communist] party in the strict sense of the word, "" and concluded that he is a ""loyal citizen"". It said that he ""had a high degree of discretion, reflecting an unusual ability to keep to himself vital secrets, "" but that he had ""a tendency to be coerced, or at least"

It said that he ""had a high degree of discretion, reflecting an unusual ability to keep to himself vital secrets, "" but that he had ""a tendency to be coerced, or at least influenced in conduct, for a period of years."", [88], The board found that Oppenheimer's association with Chevalier ""is not the kind of thing that our security system permits on the part of one who customarily has access to information of the highest classification"", and concluded that ""Oppenheimer's continuing conduct reflects a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system, "" that he was susceptible ""to influence which could have serious implications for the security interests of the country, "" that his attitude toward the H-bomb program raised doubt about whether his future participation ""would be consistent with the best interests of security, "" and that Oppenheimer had been ""less than candid in several instances"" in his testimony. The majority therefore did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated., [89], In a brief dissent, Evans argued that Oppenheimer's security clearance should be reinstated. He pointed out that most of the AEC charges had been in the hands of the AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that ""to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security"

Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that ""our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country, "" and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development., [90], Protest by scientists at Los Alamos, [, edit, ], Starting on June 7, 1954, led by physicist Fred Ribe, 494 scientists at, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, signed a petition in protest of the security board's decision., [91], The petition was delivered to President Eisenhower, the members of the AEC, and the chair of the JCAE., [92], The petition acknowledged that it was up to the government to decide who they wanted as advisors, but said that ""it is inexcusable to employ the personnel security system as a means of dispensing with the services of a loyal but unwanted consultant."", [92], The petition then asserted that ""this poorly founded decision ... will"

Graves, Elizabeth Riddle Graves, David L. Hill, Nicholas Metropolis, Frederick Reines, and, Raemer Schreiber, ., [94], [95], Over 80 percent of the scientists in the theoretical division signed the petition, [94], as did about half of the scientists in the laboratory overall., [96], Fear of professional retribution reportedly kept some others from signing it., [96], Nichols letter and AEC ruling, [, edit, ], In a harshly worded memorandum to the AEC on June 12, 1954, Nichols recommended that Oppenheimer's security clearance not be reinstated. In five ""security findings"", Nichols said that Oppenheimer was ""a Communist in every sense except that he did not carry a party card, "" and that the Chevalier incident indicated that Oppenheimer ""is not reliable or trustworthy"", and that his misstatements might have represented criminal conduct. He said that Oppenheimer's ""obstruction and disregard for security"" showed ""a consistent disregard of a reasonable security system.""

The Nichols memorandum was not made public nor provided to Oppenheimer's lawyers, who were not allowed to appear before the AEC., [97], On June 29, 1954, the AEC upheld the findings of the Personnel Security Board, with four commissioners voting in favor and one, Henry DeWolf Smyth, opposed., [98], The decision was rendered 32 hours before Oppenheimer's consultant contract, and with it the need for a clearance, was due to expire., [99], In his majority opinion, Strauss said that Oppenheimer had displayed ""fundamental character defects"". He said that Oppenheimer ""in his associations had repeatedly exhibited a willful disregard of the normal and proper obligations of security, "" and that he ""has defaulted not once but many times upon the obligations that should and must be willingly borne by citizens in the national service."", [100], Despite the promise of confidentiality, the AEC released an edited transcript of the hearing in June 1954, after press publicity of the hearing., [101], The transcript was titled, In the Matter of J.

Although he was not fired from his job at the, Institute for Advanced Study, as he had feared he might be, he became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create., [105], He gave public lectures, [106], and spent several months of each year on the small island of, Saint John, in the, Caribbean, ., [107], Kai Bird, and, Martin J. Sherwin, considered the Oppenheimer case ""a defeat for American liberalism""., [108], Summing up the fallout from the case, they wrote that:, In a few years after World War II, scientists had been regarded as a new class of intellectuals, members of a public-policy priesthood who might legitimately offer expertise not only as scientists but as public philosophers. With Oppenheimer's defrocking, scientists knew that in the future they would serve the state only as experts only on narrow scientific issues.

As sociologist, Daniel Bell, later observed, Oppenheimer's ordeal signified that the postwar ""messianic role of the scientists"" was now at an end. Scientists working within the system could not dissent from government policy, as Oppenheimer had done by writing his 1953, Foreign Affairs, essay, and still expect to serve on government advisory boards. The trial thus represented a watershed in the relations of the scientist to the government. The narrowest version of how American scientists should serve their country had triumphed., [109], Oppenheimer was seen by many in the scientific community as a, martyr, to, McCarthyism, a modern, Galileo, or, Socrates, [105], an intellectual and progressive unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific creativity from academia into the military., [110], Patrick McGrath noted that ""Scientists and administrators such as Edward Teller, Lewis Strauss and Ernest Lawrence, with their full-throated militarism and anti-communism pushed American scientists and their institutions toward a nearly complete and subservient devotion to American military interests."", [108], Scientists continued to work for the AEC, but they no longer trusted it., [111], Loyalty and security tests spread through the federal government.

Is that true?, What were your feelings at that time concerning, race equality, ?, Have you ever made statements about the ""downtrodden masses"" and ""underprivileged people""?, [112], Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb would never escape the public identification of them with the case., [105], In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman, asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President, John F. Kennedy, decided that the time had come to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963, Enrico Fermi Award, . The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was, assassinated later that day, . The award was presented by President, Lyndon B. Johnson, instead., [113], Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967., [114], Wernher von Braun, summed up his opinion about the matter with a quip to a Congressional committee: ""In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted."", [115], Later analysis of charges, [, edit, ],"

Its real purpose was larger, however: to punish the most prominent American critic of the U.S. move from atomic weapons to the much more lethal hydrogen bomb."" After the hearing, Lacayo said, ""Oppenheimer would never again feel comfortable as a public advocate for a sane nuclear policy."", [117], In a lengthy analysis of the security case published in the, Stanford Law Review, in 1990, Cold War historian, Barton J. Bernstein, posits that the remarkable thing about Oppenheimer was that he was ever able to hold a high-level security clearance in the first place, given his past associations and record of evasions, and that he had been given special treatment and protection by the U.S. government to allow him to work in the classified nuclear area"
"Review, in 1990, Cold War historian, Barton J. Bernstein, posits that the remarkable thing about Oppenheimer was that he was ever able to hold a high-level security clearance in the first place, given his past associations and record of evasions, and that he had been given special treatment and protection by the U.S. government to allow him to work in the classified nuclear area for as long as he did., [118], Cornell University, historian, Richard Polenberg, noted that Oppenheimer testified about the left-wing behavior of his colleagues and speculated that if his clearance had not been stripped, he would have been remembered as someone who had ""named names"" to save his own reputation., [119], [120], In his book, Brotherhood of the Bomb: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller, (2002), Gregg Herken, a senior historian at the Smithsonian Institution, contended, based on newly discovered documentation, that Oppenheimer was a member of the Communist Party., [116], However, Herken did not subscribe to the Borden letter's charge: ""I don't think he was a spy. The significance of his being a Communist was that it gave him something he had to hide, and may be one explanation of why he was so quiet after 1954."", [116], In a seminar at, The Wilson Center, on May 20, 2009, [121], and based on an extensive analysis of Alexander Vassiliev's notes taken while viewing, KGB, archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets.

Soviet intelligence tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and, Venona, documentation released after the fall of the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies with the Soviet Union., [122], AEC action nullified, [, edit, ], Over the years, the physicist Ribe, who had organized the 1954 petition, worked towards having the Oppenheimer charges undone, [123], as did other scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory., [124], Historians also pressed for revocation to be reversed, without success., [125], [126], Oppenheimer biographers, Kai Bird, and, Martin J.

Security clearance adjudication proceedings necessarily depend on sensitive judgments regarding the credibility of oral testimony and other evidence best evaluated within its own context.

But while not ruling on those merits, Granholm concluded that the AEC failed to ""follow its own rules"" and that ""these failures were material to the fairness of the proceeding."", [129], Historian, Alex Wellerstein, said the action did not ""go as far as Oppenheimer and his family would have wanted.

"Oppenheimer as an important historical figure and a symbol for atomic bomb ethics and political discourse about nuclear power. The book delves into various components of Oppenheimer's life inside and outside the Manhattan Project. His early life, ambitions, ideas, political activities, marriage, relationships with other women and physicists, misgivings about the bomb, complexities, and shortcomings are also discussed in the book., The book served as inspiration for, Christopher Nolan, 's 2023, biographical film, Oppenheimer, starring, Cillian Murphy, as Oppenheimer., Summary, [, edit, ], The book includes five parts on different stages of Oppenheimer's life, as well as a prologue and epilogue., Prologue, [, edit, ], The prologue describes Oppenheimer's funeral and frames Oppenheimer's life as one of triumph and tragedy, a life of enigma, complexity, humanity, and love for his country. The prologue explains that the book is an attempt to elucidate Oppenheimer's life., Part 1, [, edit, ], Part one of the book begins tracing Oppenheimer's childhood and early education at the, Ethical Culture School, and, Harvard, describing Oppenheimer's precocious academic abilities, love for the nature of the, southwestern United States, and passion for physics. Oppenheimer commented on his childhood, ""My life as a child did not prepare me for the fact that the world is full of cruel and bitter things."", [2], The authors recount Oppenheimer's emotional crisis at the, University of Cambridge, his academic flourishment as a, theoretical physicist, at, Göttingen, and his role as the founder of the theoretical physics program at the, University of California, Berkeley, . Versatile in many subjects,"

Versatile in many subjects, Oppenheimer formed his own cult of admirers, established an international reputation as a scientist, and developed an interest in the humanities and literature, including, Hindu scriptures, ., Part 2, [, edit, ], While a professor at Berkeley, Oppenheimer began an intense relationship with graduate student, Jean Tatlock, which instilled a new interest in social and political activism. Amidst the, Great Depression, Oppenheimer developed an appeal for the unemployed and migrant farmers and later gave donations for, Spanish relief, through the, Communist Party of America, (CPUSA) and funded, refugees, from, Nazi Germany, . At Berkeley, Oppenheimer held union meetings at his home and maintained an inner circle of students who became associated with left-wing activities. Oppenheimer's brother, Frank, joined the Communist Party to Robert's disapproval., Despite Oppenheimer's activism, the book points out that his exact relationship with the communist party remains unclear. Reports of friends and associates such as, Haakon Chevalier, and, FBI, recordings could merely portray him as a, fellow traveler, . Never formally having a card and later denying he ever had a membership, Oppenheimer described his interaction with the party as ""very brief and very intense."", [3], With new developments"

Reports of friends and associates such as, Haakon Chevalier, and, FBI, recordings could merely portray him as a, fellow traveler, . Never formally having a card and later denying he ever had a membership, Oppenheimer described his interaction with the party as ""very brief and very intense."", [3], With new developments in fission research and the United States' entrance into the war, Oppenheimer shifted away from union organization and cut off communist friends, believing that otherwise, the government would not allow him to work on a fission bomb project. Oppenheimer was convinced that the acquisition of the bomb before the Nazis was essential, even if there were a remote possibility the bomb could ignite the atmosphere. In spite of having no army security clearance, he became a key intellectual leader in the top secret research "", Uranium Committee, ."", Leslie Groves was selected to lead the, Manhattan Project, to develop the first nuclear bomb. Impressed by Oppenheimer, Groves appointed Oppenheimer as director of the Radiation Lab despite significant opposition that Oppenheimer was too impractical., Part two ends by portraying what would be called the Chevalier Affair. Although many versions of the story exist, sources confirm that a friend asked Oppenheimer to provide confidential information for the Soviets, which Oppenheimer outright rejected. The affair would later become a crucial issue in Oppenheimer's security hearing., Part 3, [, edit, ], At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer became the scientific director of the Manhattan Project and transformed into"
"what would be called the Chevalier Affair. Although many versions of the story exist, sources confirm that a friend asked Oppenheimer to provide confidential information for the Soviets, which Oppenheimer outright rejected. The affair would later become a crucial issue in Oppenheimer's security hearing., Part 3, [, edit, ], At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer became the scientific director of the Manhattan Project and transformed into a charismatic, effective, organized administrator and patriotic leader. The book highlights how tight security, excess secrecy, and constant military surveillance burdened Oppenheimer and other scientists. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer met Jean Tatlock several times before discontinuing the relationship, after which she committed suicide., Despite suspicion and doubts by subordinates, Oppenheimer eventually acquired a security clearance but soon after told authorities about the Chevalier incident. While Groves believed Oppenheimer and Oppenheimer asserted there was no security threat, Oppenheimer's decision to tell the story would become disastrous for his security hearing. Bird and Sherwin argue that Oppenheimer was committed to his trustworthiness as a scientist and the project's success rather than to an invariable loyalty to the United States., Niels Bohr, came to Los Alamos to discuss the implications of the bomb. He argued for openness to avoid a post-war nuclear arms race with Russia, a policy Oppenheimer would later promote. As one student noted, ""Bohr was God, and Oppie was his prophet."", [4], The scientists at Los Alamos continued discussions on the moral and political ramifications of the ""gadget"" or atomic bomb., After the defeat of the Nazis, colleagues of Oppenheimer began to doubt the"
"He argued for openness to avoid a post-war nuclear arms race with Russia, a policy Oppenheimer would later promote. As one student noted, ""Bohr was God, and Oppie was his prophet."", [4], The scientists at Los Alamos continued discussions on the moral and political ramifications of the ""gadget"" or atomic bomb., After the defeat of the Nazis, colleagues of Oppenheimer began to doubt the purpose of the bomb and debated whether to use the bomb without warning or have a demonstration of the bomb for Japan. Oppenheimer supported the immediate use of the bomb, believing it might end all wars. Bird and Sherwin claim that Oppenheimer was unaware of any surrender talks by the Japanese., The book describes the influential presence of Oppenheimer in the physical production of the bomb. After some crisis about the bomb design, Oppenheimer pressed for the, plutonium implosion bomb, with lenses. Part three ends by detailing the, Trinity Test, of the first nuclear bomb., Part 4, [, edit, ], The book continues by exploring the events following the Trinity Test. Oppenheimer was aware of possible targets in Japan and would play a vital part in the efficiency of the atomic bombings of, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, . The authors recount Oppenheimer's serious qualms about the implications of the bombings and nuclear weapons. He later told, President Truman, ""I feel I have blood on my hands, "" a statement that would alienate the president from him., [5], Considered the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer became a celebrity, icon, and a scientist-statesman who"
"of the atomic bombings of, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, . The authors recount Oppenheimer's serious qualms about the implications of the bombings and nuclear weapons. He later told, President Truman, ""I feel I have blood on my hands, "" a statement that would alienate the president from him., [5], Considered the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer became a celebrity, icon, and a scientist-statesman who was now influential in American politics. Oppenheimer hoped using the bombs would prevent a, nuclear arms race, with Russia. He urged for a transparent international regulation of atomic weapons and energy but soon supported a more conservative defensive stance to proliferate American nuclear weapons due to apparent ideological differences between Russia and the United States., As chairman of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission, Oppenheimer opposed the accelerated construction of the Super (, H-bomb, ). Despite the government's decision to move forward with the bomb, Oppenheimer continued his role as chairman but remained an outspoken critic of the bomb., Increased political influence led to greater surveillance by the FBI led by, J. Edgar Hoover, to investigate Oppenheimer's communist connections. Oppenheimer was asked to testify at a, HUAC, hearing and became an informant regarding former students' communist relations. In another meeting, Oppenheimer criticized communism and claimed he was ""a resolute anti-communist"" but continued to face suspicions and accusations of communist ties., [6], The book shows how Oppenheimer, amidst a stalemate of, Cold War, policy, became more estranged from politics in Washington, while still fatefully trying to remain an insider.,"

However, Oppenheimer would eventually humiliate Strauss in a congressional hearing, increasing animosity between the two. Seeking revenge, Strauss began investigating Oppenheimer with the help of the FBI and initiated a campaign to suppress Oppenheimer's political influence and smear his reputation. As chairman of the AEC, Strauss pushed forward with nuclear secrecy and proliferation. Eventually, President Eisenhower, attempted to cut off Oppenheimer from all government contacts and create a ""blank wall"" between the scientist and classified material., [7], The book also covers the stormy relationship between, Katherine, and Oppenheimer, in which Kitty appears extremely passionate and intense and Oppenheimer more disengaged. Kitty's desire for Oppenheimer to gain fame is also mentioned., Part 5, [, edit, ], The last part of the book deals primarily with Oppenheimer's, security hearing, and its aftermath. The authors argue that the proceedings constituted a, kangaroo court, orchestrated by Lewis Strauss, in which Oppenheimer was intentionally humiliated.

"for Oppenheimer to gain fame is also mentioned., Part 5, [, edit, ], The last part of the book deals primarily with Oppenheimer's, security hearing, and its aftermath. The authors argue that the proceedings constituted a, kangaroo court, orchestrated by Lewis Strauss, in which Oppenheimer was intentionally humiliated. The hearing board concluded that Oppenheimer was a security threat due to his past conduct and associations, stance on the hydrogen bomb, and less than candid responses. A following letter claimed that ""Dr. Oppenheimer was a Communist in every respect except for the fact that he did not carry a party card."", [8], Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked, and he became in the public eye a scientist-martyr and victim of, McCarthyism, . According to Bird and Sherwin, the hearing was a crucial turning point in the relations between scientists and the government and proved a defeat for American liberalism. Although an ""exiled intellectual, "" he would continue to lecture, write and give speeches., [9], Oppenheimer would eventually receive the, Enrico Fermi Award, but only over fifteen years after the Trinity Test., Epilogue, [, edit, ], The epilogue covers the lives of Oppenheimer's family and children after his death from, throat cancer, . Frank became a successful theoretical physicist. Kitty took up sailing but later died of an embolism. Peter, Oppenheimer's son, would settle in New Mexico and start a family, and Toni, Oppenheimer's daughter, would eventually commit suicide., Production, [, edit, ], Historian, Martin J.

"children after his death from, throat cancer, . Frank became a successful theoretical physicist. Kitty took up sailing but later died of an embolism. Peter, Oppenheimer's son, would settle in New Mexico and start a family, and Toni, Oppenheimer's daughter, would eventually commit suicide., Production, [, edit, ], Historian, Martin J. Sherwin, who had previously written, A World Destroyed: Hiroshima and Its Legacies, (1975), started to work on the Oppenheimer biography in 1979, [10], and signed the first contract with the publisher, Knopf, on March 13, 1980, for $70, 000., [11], Between 1979 and 1985, [10], he conducted interviews ""with 112 persons in his [Oppenheimer's] orbit"", [12], including his friend, Haakon Chevalier, and his son Peter, who refused a formal interview. Sherwin gathered ""some 50, 000 pages of interviews, transcripts, letters, diaries, declassified documents and F.B.I. dossiers, stored in seemingly endless boxes in his basement, attic and office"". After the deadline had come, and after his editor's retirement, Sherwin had still not finished the book., [11], Thomas Powers, writes that ""historians of the subject, a small gossiping group, suggested that Sherwin was the latest victim of the curse of Oppenheimer""., [10], The book became a joke in Sherwin's family, and he said ""that he was going to take the book to the grave""., [13], In 1999 Sherwin invited his friend, writer and editor, Kai Bird, [11], who had already written two political biographies, [10], to join him and put it together in a cohesive and readable format.

"book became a joke in Sherwin's family, and he said ""that he was going to take the book to the grave""., [13], In 1999 Sherwin invited his friend, writer and editor, Kai Bird, [11], who had already written two political biographies, [10], to join him and put it together in a cohesive and readable format. At first Bird refused, but eventually agreed to work on the book, and both authors signed a new contract with Knopf, for a further $290, 000. Bird wrote drafts that were then reviewed and rewritten by Sherwin., [11], The working title of the book was, Oppie, but that was vetoed by their editor. Susan Goldmark, Bird's wife, suggested the new title: "", Prometheus, … fire … the bomb is this fire. And you could put 'American' there."" Sherwin said that his friend, Ronald Steel, independently suggested the same title., [11], First comparison of the physicists who made the bomb possible to Prometheus was in the, Scientific Monthly, in September 1945: ""Modern Prometheans have raided Mount Olympus again and have brought back for man the very thunderbolts of Zeus."", [14], Some reviewers also connected the name of the book to, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, ., [15], Reception, [, edit, ], The biography was praised by critics., The Boston Globe, wrote that the book ""stands as an Everest among the mountains of books on the bomb project and Oppenheimer, and is an achievement not likely to be surpassed or equaled."", [11], Janet Maslin wrote in her, The New York Times, review that"

It succeeds in deeply fathoming his most damaging, self-contradictory behavior."" She noted that it is ""a thorough examination and synthesis, sometimes overwhelming in its detail""., [16], Another reviewer notes that ""there is no mathematics and very little physics. There is little about the engineering of the “gadget” tested in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945."", [17], Thomas Powers, in his review of several Oppenheimer biographies for, The New York Review, noted that Sherwin had an advantage in writing Oppenheimer's biography in 1979. Many friends and colleagues of Oppenheimer were, at that time, still alive., [10], Powers described the book as ""clear in its purpose, deeply felt, persuasively argued, disciplined in form, and written with a sustained literary power"", and notes the complex character of Oppenheimer:, [10], But it is Oppenheimer the man, not general ideas about the, nuclear age, that dominates these pages.

"disciplined in form, and written with a sustained literary power"", and notes the complex character of Oppenheimer:, [10], But it is Oppenheimer the man, not general ideas about the, nuclear age, that dominates these pages. Oppenheimer emerges in all his complexity — a brainy theorist but also an ""underdogger"", quick in his sympathy for those at the bottom of the social ladder; a sometime revolutionary who irritated former students like Philip Morrison with his talk after the war about ""Dean"" and ""George""—, Dean Acheson, and, George Marshall, ; devoted defender of his alcoholic wife, Kitty, but blind to her ego-crushing treatment of their son, Peter; lifelong friend of students like, Serber, and betrayer of students like, Rossi Lomanitz, Joseph Weinberg, and, Bernard Peters, whom he simply threw to the Red-hunting wolves., Frank A. Settle called the book ""meticulously researched"" and ""the most comprehensive biography to date""., [18], Braham Dabscheck notes the ""scholarship of the highest order""., [12], John S. Rigden, calls the book ""well written and almost free of serious errors"", and that ""reading this worthy book is a gripping experience: It stimulates the mind and stirs the emotions."", [19], Thomas A. Julian critiqued the book and the authors, writing that ""[t]hey still assert, despite the conclusive evidence to the contrary ... that Japan was already defeated and wanted to 'surrender, ', "", and that they ""ignore disturbing evidence provided from former Soviet sources that Oppenheimer might have provided information to the Soviet Union about the U.S. atomic bomb project""., [20], Awards, [, edit, ], 2005,"

Robert Oppenheimer—the substance of his life, his intellect, his patrician manner, his leadership of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, his political affiliations and postwar military/security entanglements, and his early death from cancer, amount to a highly compelling story., Born Julius Robert Oppenheimer on April 22, 1904, in New York City, Oppenheimer grew up in a Manhattan apartment adorned with paintings by van Gogh, Cézanne, and Gauguin. His father, Julius Oppenheimer, was a German immigrant who worked in his family's textile importing business. His mother, Ella Friedman, was a painter whose family had been in New York for generations. His younger brother, Frank, would also become a physicist., In 1921, Oppenheimer graduated from the Ethical Culture School of New York at the top of his class. At Harvard, Oppenheimer studied mathematics and science, philosophy and Eastern religion, and French and English literature. He was admitted to graduate standing in physics in his first year as an undergraduate on the basis of independent study. During a course on thermodynamics taught by Percy Bridgman, Higgins University Professor of Physics at Harvard, Oppenheimer was introduced to experimental physics, which quickly caught his attention. He graduated summa cum laude in 1925 and afterwards went to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory as research assistant to J. J. Thomson."
"in physics in his first year as an undergraduate on the basis of independent study. During a course on thermodynamics taught by Percy Bridgman, Higgins University Professor of Physics at Harvard, Oppenheimer was introduced to experimental physics, which quickly caught his attention. He graduated summa cum laude in 1925 and afterwards went to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory as research assistant to J. J. Thomson. Uninspired by routine laboratory work, he went to the University of Göttingen, in Germany, to study quantum physics. Oppenheimer met and studied with some of the day's most prominent figures, including Max Born and Niels Bohr. In 1927, Oppenheimer received his doctorate, and in the same year, he worked with Born on the structure of molecules, producing the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation. Subsequently, he traveled from one prominent center of physics to another: Harvard, California Institute of Technology, Leyden, and Zürich. In 1929, he received offers to teach at Caltech and the University of California at Berkeley. Accepting both, he divided his time between Pasadena and Berkeley, attracting his own circle of brilliant young physics students., Oppenheimer in 1947 at the Shelter Island conference where theoretical physicists gathered to discuss the state of their field in the aftermath of World War II.

Feynman (seated, with pen in hand), and Herman Feshbach, “His lectures were a great experience, for experimental as well as theoretical physicists, ” commented the late physicist Hans Bethe (1906–2005), who would later work with Oppenheimer at Los Alamos. “In addition to a superb literary style, he brought to them a degree of sophistication in physics previously unknown in the United States. Here was a man who obviously understood all the deep secrets of quantum mechanics, and yet made it clear that the most important questions were unanswered. His earnestness and deep involvement gave his research students the same sense of challenge. He never gave his students the easy and superficial answers but trained them to appreciate and work on the deep problems.”, When Julius Oppenheimer died in 1937, Oppenheimer became a wealthy man. In 1940, he married Katherine (Kitty) Puening Harrison, a biologist and divorcee whose second husband had been killed during the Spanish Civil War. The couple had two children, Peter and Katherine., World War II interrupted the work and lives of most American physicists.

"a biologist and divorcee whose second husband had been killed during the Spanish Civil War. The couple had two children, Peter and Katherine., World War II interrupted the work and lives of most American physicists. In 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed to the Manhattan Project, code name for the project formed to develop an atomic bomb., The project involved several laboratories in secret locations across the country, including the University of Chicago; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Oppenheimer oversaw the construction of the Los Alamos laboratory, where he gathered the best minds in physics to work on the problem of creating an atomic bomb. Because of his leadership in this project, he is often referred to as the “father” of the atomic bomb., Alan Richards, Robert Oppenheimer (right) with John von Neumann in front of the Electronic Computer Project’s ENIAC machine, ca. 1952., When the war ended, the government set up the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to replace the Manhattan Project. The AEC was charged with overseeing all atomic research and development in the United States. As Chairman of the General Advisory Committee, Oppenheimer opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. Known as the “Super Bomb, ” the hydrogen bomb was a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb. In the context of the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power, Oppenheimer's stance was controversial.

"bomb. Known as the “Super Bomb, ” the hydrogen bomb was a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb. In the context of the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power, Oppenheimer's stance was controversial. In the 1950s, while Oppenheimer was Director of the Institute, anti-Communist hysteria was sweeping through Washington, D.C., spearheaded by the conservative Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. McCarthy and anti-Communist zealots devoted themselves to rooting out Communist spies from every walk of American life. Oppenheimer was subjected to a security investigation that became a cause célèbre and divided the intellectual and scientific community. In 1953, he was denied security clearance and lost his position with the AEC. Doors that had formerly been open to him were closed. “Oppenheimer took the outcome of the security hearing very quietly but he was a changed person; much of his previous spirit and liveliness had left him, ” recalled Bethe., Oppenheimer’s concern for the general public’s lack of scientific understanding, and the difficulty of conveying the content of scientific discoveries as well as the exhilaration of the creative act of discovery to even educated lay people, led to several popular essays on science. He delivered the Reith Lectures on the BBC in 1953, and these were published under the title “Science and the Common Understanding.”, In April 1962, the U.S. Government made amends for the treatment Oppenheimer suffered during the McCarthy years, when President Kennedy invited him to a White House dinner of Nobel Prize winners.

In 1963, President Johnson awarded Oppenheimer the highest honor given by the AEC, the Fermi Award., Oppenheimer died of throat cancer on February 18, 1967., A number of plays have been written about Oppenheimer, and American composer John Adams (, Nixon in China, ) composed an opera commissioned by the San Francisco Opera entitled, Doctor Atomic, which premiered in September 2005. There are also a large number of books on Oppenheimer and his life, including most recently, J.

I think that one can give only a metaphysical ground for this evaluation; but the variety of metaphysics which gave an answer to your question has been very great, the metaphysics themselves very disparate: the bhagavad gita, Ecclesiastes, the Stoa, the beginning of the Laws, Hugo of St Victor, St Thomas, John of the Cross, Spinoza. This very great disparity suggests that the fact that discipline is good for the soul is more fundamental than any of the grounds given for its goodness. I believe that through discipline, though not through discipline alone, we can achieve serenity, and a certain small but precious measure of freedom from the accidents of incarnation, and charity, and that detachment which preserves the world which it renounces. I believe that through discipline we can learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances, and to abandon with simplicity what would else have seemed to us indispensable; that we come a little to see the world"
"measure of freedom from the accidents of incarnation, and charity, and that detachment which preserves the world which it renounces. I believe that through discipline we can learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances, and to abandon with simplicity what would else have seemed to us indispensable; that we come a little to see the world without the gross distortion of personal desire, and in seeing it so, accept more easily our earthly privation and its earthly horror—But because I believe that the reward of discipline is greater than its immediate objective, I would not have you think that discipline without objective is possible: in its nature discipline involves the subjection of the soul to some perhaps minor end; and that end must be real, if the discipline is not to be factitious. Therefore I think that all things which evoke discipline: study, and our duties to men and to the commonwealth, war, and personal hardship, and even the need for subsistence, ought to be greeted by us with profound gratitude, for only through them can we attain to the least detachment; and only so can we know peace.”, ―, J.

In 1942, amid, World War II, U.S. Army, General, Leslie Groves, recruits Oppenheimer to lead the, Manhattan Project, to develop an, atomic bomb, . Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis potentially completing their, nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. He assembles a scientific team including Rabi and, Edward Teller, in, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and, David L. Hill, at the, University of Chicago, . Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could possibly trigger a, chain reaction that ignites the atmosphere, and, destroys the world, .

The, Trinity test, is successful, and President, Harry S. Truman, orders, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to be bombed, forcing, Japan's surrender, . Oppenheimer, though publicly praised, is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities, and urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman curtly dismisses. As an advisor to the, United States Atomic Energy Commission, (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amid the burgeoning, Cold War, . AEC Chairman, Lewis Strauss, resents Oppenheimer for publicly humiliating him by dismissing his concerns about exporting, radioisotopes, and for recommending negotiations with the, Soviet Union, after they, successfully detonated their own bomb, . He also believes that Oppenheimer previously denigrated him to Einstein in 1947., In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a, private hearing, before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's, Q clearance, .
